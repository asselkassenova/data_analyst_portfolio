### Task 

Develope predictive model that can effectively forecast the occurrence of a stroke based on the provided features.

### Description

This project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset to predict strokes in patients. The dataset includes information like age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and gender. Each entry represents a patient, and the features capture stroke-related risk factors.

The dataset we'll be using includes various features related to patients' health and lifestyle. Each row represents a unique patient and includes attributes such as age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and gender. The dataset also includes a target variable 'stroke' representing the occurrence of a stroke.

### To Do

Here's a brief overview of our workflow for this project:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** 
Load the data and preprocess it for analysis and modeling. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables, and handling class imbalance. 

2. **Discriptive Data Analysis:** 
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distributions of features, and explore potential relationships between the features and the stroke outcome. 

3. **Data Cleaning:** 
Perform imputing missing values and data transformation to improve the model's performance.

4. **Model Training and Validation:** 
Train the model using a train-test split strategy and make predictions on the test set. 

5. **Model Evaluation:** 
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve, and assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data using the test set.

6. **Prediction:** 
Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. If applicable, deploy the model for practical use or further analysis. 

This workflow provides a structured approach to analyzing the dataset, building a predictive model, and evaluating its performance. By following this workflow, we can gain insights into the dataset, develop an accurate predictive model, and make informed decisions based on the model's predictions. 


## What is in DATASET?  

- **`age`**: This is the age of the patient. Age is a crucial factor in stroke prediction as the risk of stroke increases with age. According to the World Health Organization, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after the age of 55. 

- **`hypertension`**: This is a binary feature indicating whether the patient has hypertension (high blood pressure) or not. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can damage blood vessels, making them prone to blockage or rupture.

- **`heart_disease`**: This binary feature indicates whether the patient has heart disease or not. Patients with heart diseases are at a higher risk of stroke as these conditions can lead to the formation of clots in the heart that can travel to the brain. ❤️

- **`ever_married`**: This feature represents whether the patient is married or not. Although not a direct risk factor for stroke, marital status can be associated with lifestyle factors that influence stroke risk. For instance, married individuals might have different stress levels, physical activity patterns, or dietary habits compared to their unmarried counterparts. 

- **`work_type`**: This categorical feature describes the type of occupation of the patient. Certain occupations might be associated with higher stress levels or sedentary behavior, which can influence stroke risk.

- **`Residence_type`**: This feature indicates whether the patient lives in a rural or urban area. The place of residence might be associated with stroke risk due to factors like access to healthcare, air quality, lifestyle habits, etc. 

- **`avg_glucose_level`**: This feature represents the average glucose level in the patient's blood. High blood glucose levels can damage blood vessels, leading to an increased risk of stroke.

- **`bmi`**: This is the Body Mass Index of the patient, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can lead to or exacerbate conditions like hypertension, high blood glucose, and heart disease. 

- **`smoking_status`**: This categorical feature indicates whether the patient is a smoker, former smoker, or never smoked. Smoking can increase stroke risk as it can damage blood vessels, increase blood pressure, and reduce the amount of oxygen reaching the brain.

- **`gender`**: This feature represents the gender of the patient. Gender can influence stroke risk due to biological differences and gender-specific lifestyle patterns.

This study presents a detailed examination and modeling of a healthcare dataset with the primary aim of predicting stroke incidence at the patient level .

The exploratory data analysis highlighted significant differences in the distribution of stroke and no-stroke cases, illustrating the impact of various health and lifestyle factors on stroke risk. We also encountered missing data in the 'bmi' feature, emphasizing the necessity for effective missing data imputation methods  in healthcare prediction tasks.

We used the power of gradient boosting, specifically the xboost, to predict stroke occurrence. The model was rigorously trained and validated using a train-test split strategy, delivering remarkable results on several performance metrics.

The stroke predictions produced by the model were evaluated using a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance . This approach highlights the importance of utilizing multiple evaluation metrics in imbalanced classification tasks .

This project underscores the potential of machine learning  in healthcare prediction tasks, providing insights that could aid in patient risk assessment , healthcare planning , and strategy formulation in clinical settings . Future work could focus on refining the prediction model, exploring different strategies for class balancing , and integrating additional patient data  to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of stroke predictions .
