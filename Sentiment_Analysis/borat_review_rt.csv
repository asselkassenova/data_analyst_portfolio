                        Enjoyable movie. Lacks the shock factor of the original but has enough laughs to make this an enjoyable ride. Effective in shining a light on the mess that is the partisanship of American politics and to a degree it's culture in the present day.

                        Not as great as the original, but still pretty funny with some decent political commentary. So I give it a ‘pretty good' movie rating, as you can never really go wrong with a Sacha Baron Cohen film.

                        While overall, this movie was a fun time it sometimes felt as if it spent more time pushing is political agenda rather then the classic Borat comedy. Standalone I would recommend this movie although compared to the first subsequent movie film does not live up to par. Definitely a very different movie that has its own feel and merit but lacks the formula that made the original so good.

                        Sacha Baron Cohen still proves he's a comedic genius as his hilarious Kazakh character Borat. It's great watching Cohen mess with Americans and showing how people will believe anything he shoves in their face. Maria Bakalova does a great job at keeping up with Cohen's humor. Borat 2 isn't as good as its predecessor but it's still a funny film and definitely worth a watch. If you didn't like it you're probably one of the American Trump supporters that this film makes fun of

As always, sascha delivered new different pictures for comedy hunger audience which we truely deserve by the way this whole year round. 
I was just bumbed out that it took 14 years to make a sequel which i defined the #1 comedy documentary that has been ever made but i forgive sascha. Big thumbs up to this guy. Him and will ferrel, both comedy geniuses!

                        Actually better than the first film, simply for the addition of his adorable daughter. There was at least a little less toilet humour too, which was so damned crude in the first movie. 

I've read that Sacha Cohen deliberately made this movie as a warning. He included extremist political views in order to show how dangerous they are, and how bad it would be if Trump got elected the second time. He says so himself, then ends the movie with the message that people should vote. But it's still very crude, and again I feel that even though it's meant to be sarcastic, the people who really have these racist, sexist, and homophobic attitudes probably enjoy the hell out of seeing themselves getting attention like this.

                        I love the Borat character and was curious how they could follow up the hugely successful first one.  In this one Borat is tasked by his government to bring a gift mod a famous monkey to Vice President Mike Pence, however things go awry when his teenage daughter escapes her cage and stows away with the monkey.  Smart idea to use the daughter character to integrate with the unsuspecting marks in the awkward situations with real people and putting Borat in disguise due to people recognizing him.  
Not nearly as side splittingly funny as the original but a fun follow up.

                        Problematic in certain non-political aspects, but this surprisingly superior sequel is sharper and riotously funnier in its timely topical deliverance of the ultimate satire precisely tackling its current political climate with authentic exposure subtly leading up to a connectively twisted proportion. Sacha Baron Cohen's daring return in a spy-like position of genius infiltration, unveiling further true colors during that time, while playing with the uneducated then in the meanwhile evolved his comedic presence and embrace the parodied familial heart honestly mark his otherworldly peak, alongside Maria Bakalova's solid breakthrough at generational craft. Those depicted and exposed will be humiliated, offended in a pitiful matter with little repetitive defense, while some with pure intentions will be betrayed but eventually reassured on good notes that should spell better approach. Between the amusement and topical treatment amid frivolous tackle, this is probably the best mockumentary, in recent memory and existential acknowledgement, for its entertainment value of unpredictable impacts with enough certification to be worthily claimed as a documentary by half. (B+)

                        What can you really say about this film? It's peak Sacha Baron Cohen. The character of Borat is outrageous both with his jokes and the audacity of his public stunts. Thanks to that, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is endlessly entertaining, and it couldn't have come out at a better time.

By far the best thing about this film is the jokes. It is an incredibly funny movie. I was laughing out loud for most of the film and sometimes had a hard time believing what I was hearing. The thing that makes this film that much funnier (or perhaps scarier?), is that these are real people that Borat is interacting with. Certainly, a lot of jokes are very dark, and if you don't like that kind of humour then steer clear of this movie. However, if you don't mind that, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is hilarious.

The story part of the movie, however, felt a little out of place. It's good that there was an underlying motive for the character to do what he did. However, I did feel like a lot of the more serious and contemplative scenes didn't add much to the film. Indeed, they ended up disrupting what was an endless barrage of jokes and made the movie feel longer than it was.

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a great comedy. It is extremely funny but it also manages to underline a lot of the social difficulties that America currently faces. So please watch it now, while it's still relevant. You'll have a great time.

                        Terrible. Actually it was boring and not at all funny. Definitely experienced some secondhand embarrassment for the guy. I actually don't think Sacha Baron Cohen has not been funny since Da Ali G Show. Seems like everything he's done since then has been forced humor. Luckily for him, he seems to have made a ton of money… Maybe he should just go into politics or do something that he actually likes.

                        Uma comédia sempre é boa para dar umas boas risadas, Borat que é um filme antigo ressurge em 2020 com ideias impensáveis como prostituir a filha para políticos, e acredite se quiser cenas reais, como nas eleições dos EUA de 2020, Borat com uma maquiagem que lembrou muito o ex presidente Donald Trump (hilário!).

Foi uma coisa ao estilo das pegadinhas que levava a narrativa a um nível de seriedade que muitos acreditavam, fazendo que a piada se tornasse verdade, atuações convincentes, é algo como um compilados de 'pranks' (trotes) só que seguindo um roteiro que ficou excelente.

No final tem a revelação que foi algo bem genial, com aquele todo alvoroço de levar a filha ao Donald Trump, é que na verdade o 'manda chuva' não queria que a filha de Borat fizesse tal feito, mas sim que sem saber ele espalhasse o famoso Corona vírus ao mundo todo, não foi esperado esse final (HaHa) excelente filme.

Extremely naughty and rude to watch with it's references and portrayals of politics/groups Borat is a disgraceful example of how a movie should never been made.  Since I was forced to watch it was even worse every minute was pure torture and I didn't laugh once.  I never saw the original but I draw the line at the references.

                        This is one of the most horrible attempts at entertainment I’ve ever tried to watch. Completely different tone than the first movie. This thing ( I hate to call it a film because that is an insult to the art of film) is just awful. Wanna watch it? Go ahead and waste your time and get sick to your stomach. Time would be better spent watching grass grow or Kait punching yourself in the head ( that might lead to better results than watching this thing). Proceed with caution if watching this thing.

                        Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is the perfect sequel to Borat. Fourteen years since the last film and Sacha Baron Cohen manages to jump right back into the character of Borat, and even goes further than he did in the first film. Fans of the first Borat movie will have plenty to enjoy here, as well as people who enjoyed his more recent show Who is America. As a fan of both Sacha Baron Cohen productions I wholly enjoyed this new movie and found myself laughing throughout it. Even newcomer Maria Bakalova makes an amazing lead character, bringing just as many laughs in every scene she is a part of. This movie does have more of a story focus that connects all the interactions this duo becomes involved in, but I feel like it makes the movie as a whole flow better. People worried that Borat would not be able to bring a sequel that is worthy of the same praise the original got need not worry, as this is a movie I will watch now just as much as I watched Borat back then.

                        Raunchy comedy that makes fun of culture and societal norms.  If that is for you then so is this movie.  It is Borat, similar to the original.  Or if you like comedians like Andy Kaufman or Tom Green then this is a good bet.  There are a bunch of blatantly anti conservative themes in the movie so if that will turn you off, you probably want to skip it.

Even though I am not the biggest fan of cringe humor and I found myself not being able to look at some of the scenes, it didn't take away from the movie. You have to keep an open mind and understand that it is satire of course. I've noticed that all the people thinking this movie is horrible and disgusting are completely missing the point of the movie but i guess not everyone is capable of understanding satire. He also takes a hard hit at republicans so I'm sure anyone who is a republican and watches this wouldn't like this. Tbh he takes an innocent approach the people in the film are making themselves look bad, especially Rudy hahah I cannot believe they caught him in 4K. There is too much genius in this movie and scenes that you just can't miss to not rate it 5 stars.

                        If the first Borat movie was fun and transgressive, this second one is just a political hit piece. Instead of presenting a critique of some parts of society which were subtle in the first one, this is more cringe-worthy all out attack on what he deems his enemies, but it felt very forced and not very funny. The Holocaust arc lost it's potential very fast. The final plot twist on COVID-19 was refreshing even if it was mixed with low quality redemption tropes. Save your time for something else unless you really hate conservatives.

                        For better or worse, 2006's Borat continues to hold up today like nobody's business. The discomforting spotlight it shined on the cultural misgivings of America is unfortunately as relevant now as it was then, and as a result, its side-splitting comedy still hits like a whip fifteen years after its release. Though most comedy sequels released so distantly down the line from their progenitors tend to run on fumes, if anything, the apocalyptic political landscape of 2020 supercharged Borat Subsequent Moviefilm with an embarrassment of riches for Sacha Baron Cohen to marathon through another satirical gauntlet across the United States. As a result, this sequel's ruder and cruder, but not nearly as effective in its social commentary as the original.

You've got to commend Baron Cohen and his onscreen daughter, Maria Bakalova, for their balls of steel. Trekking through a gun rally, an extended stay with QAnon conspiracy theorists, a rapey interview with Rudy Giuliani, and more shocking set pieces, their ability to stay in character with their lives frequently at literal risk is a true miracle of moviemaking. They're great together as well, and the surprisingly touching father-daughter narrative gives the film a sincere sense of heart within the nightmarish tomfoolery surrounding it.

The thing is, with our everyday reality having overtaken the most out there bounds of fictional satire, these greater Trump era stakes are ironically not as rattling as the events of the first film. The social commentary delivered is almost too obvious, and it also doesn't help that Subsequent Moviefilm goes hard on gross-out humor during its lampooning vignettes, its pungent comedic brawn turning out less affectingly than the original's passive brains. Baron Cohen and Bakalova putting in more work for the bit just isn't as cutting as letting the abhorrent people they interview make fools of themselves on their own. Still, for its moments of borderline unbelievable scandal, the film's got enough to warrant itself a watch.

I came into this thinking that it would be stale, that everyone would recognize who Borat was, and that the addition of a daughter would be unnecessary and annoying, but boy was I wrong! Sacha Baron Cohen is just as funny as he was in the first film, and he effortlessly exposes the ignorance of Americans throughout the country. It has so many hilarious and iconic moments, and some shockingly funny cartoons involving Melania Trump. Maria Bakalova is stunning as Borat's daughter Tutar Sagdiyev, and while I thought she was going to ruin this movie, she is, in fact, what ties it together. She adds so much to the story and I really loved to see her character development and bonding with Borat. I don't really have much else to say about this movie, except that Baron Cohen's genius really shines through in a way that I thought it possibly couldn't. I gave it 4.5/5 stars because I just didn't think it was quite deserving of the full sweep, but it comes close.

                        So I didn't like the first one, and this was was worse, because so much of the satire was ill treatment of women, which just isn't funny. The Unbearable scene was the ""fertility dance"". But if I suspend judgment and see it as the vignettes around ""comedy of errors"" that it aspires to be, the best written scene was when she swallows a plastic baby, and what ensues next. Glad he only uses ""TWO"" Polish phrases, I understand everything else is Hebrew and jibberish.

                        It's fun and entertaining and it gets some good laughs, but overall, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, feels fairly basic and doesn't bring anything new to the table. Maria Bakalova gives a strong comedic performance and does a great job keeping up with Sacha Baron Cohen in all of their scenes together, but unfortunately this film just doesn't do enough to differentiate itself and ends up falling short of its predecessor.

                        Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is unsurprisingly hilarious!  It hits on some heavy topics such as shady leadership, women's rights, and COVID-19, targeting big names such as McDonald Trump and Michael Pence.  However, it doesn't quite have the spark if the first film due to Cohen being unable to be in public much with the Borat persona.  The Rudy Giuliani scene is still legendary though!

                        The guy thought of next to nothing new in his simpleton style- make situations with unsuspecting strangers sexual and/or creepy and extremely awkward(as well as keep on insulting and mocking Kazakhstan culture and its people with exaggerations and outright ignorant misinformation ). Which gets old fast and incredibly dumb. Lots of pretty ballsy non-scripted pranks he goes into with the actual Rep. party and supporters that takes guts. So props for that.  But sadly, next to no real life pranks or pokes on Dems or the party are seen in the film. Which is a shame for exposing clowns for comedy and material.  So the Sacha Baron Cohen's  bias isn't hidden if your wondering which direction he leans and protects.    Production is designed with ""shock"" value rather than brain's.

                        This film just dropped on me. ""Borat"" is a very well known film but I never heard about this follow up before it suddenly was out. It's more of the same. Borat takes a new trip to The US and A and he has brought his daughter that he tries to make pretty. I'm very fascinated by the scenes in shops and such where the people got some serious reactions to all this mayhem. I guess it's partly constructed but people does not know anything about what's coming as Borat know use some new outfits and disguises so he won't be recognized.

Wild and nasty, fun and stupid, impressive and simple film that works almost as good as the first one. Politics is a big matter, covid19 is a big matter and Sasha is showing how skilled he is at doing this. I found it weird that the people on screen is up with taking part here, but I guess some serious papers where signed just the right way for making it possible to distribute.

6 out of 10 woman cages.

                        Out of time and out of laughs, in most cases. My love for Sacha is unwavering, but Borat never feels as real or as dangerous as he used to - perhaps because his global fame/notoriety means so much of the footage has to rely on his daughter. Bakalova is the star here, but it's never clear whether it's the on-screen victims or the audience being pranked.

Sacha Baron Cohen is great as the goofy and naive Borat and he is well matched with a great performance from Maria Bakalova. Cohen and Bakalova's impressive comedic chemistry and timing drives this insane story forward and makes for a truly funny film.

                        I mean it had it's moments but it's nothing compared to the first one. I mean there was no way he could predict the success it had. But it would definitely have been smarter to film way more material at once and make two movies out of it. His daughter is great though. I think it would have been smarter to have her do everything and have Borat as nothing more than a narrator. Also part of the charm of the first one was the 90s/00s resolution flair. This one has no character. But I don't want to bash it too hard. It's definitely better than The Dictator or Bruno. Ali G wasn't for me so I'm not gonna judge that one. To sum it up, it has is laughs.  Enjoy it for what it's worth.

                        While the first Borat is one of the best movies of all time and funniest movies of all time, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is one of the worst movies of all time. While the Borat sequel had some moments, the film still has a lot of left-leaning (liberal) favoritism which would make this film an anti-conservative propaganda film. Also, this feels like a troll hunt toward conservatives. And another thing, the character of Borat and Sacha Baron Cohen are way too popular to keep doing these kinds of movies and Cohen himself got busted by random people on numerous occasions. So this movie is kind of pointless. So if you got trolled by Sacha Baron Cohen, you're not a smart person (looking at you Rudy Giuliani). I gave this movie so much hype hoping it would be as good as the first one but instead, I was left disappointed.

                        Huge disappointment, and this is coming from someone who thought the original was one of the funniest movies ever made. I'm also a huge fan of Da Ali G Show, but this sequel was just bad. It looked like they were trying to have big set ups that just didn't materialize. Take the concert for example. I was expecting something on par with 'Throw the Jew down the Well' but literally nothing happened. No riled up crowd. No controversy. It was so pedestrian.

                        A timely satire that examines the parts of America that we'd like to ignore--the politically extreme, xenophobic, conspiratorial, and misogynistic. Bakalova stands out in this film as a young actor capable of going toe to toe with Cohen in the scenes she shares with him. The father-daughter plot with Cohen and Bakalova elevate Borat II over the original if for nothing else than helping to string together relatively loose comedic skits into an order that fashions itself as a more identifiable plot. In some crazy way this actually allows for some (at least minimal) character growth in Borat as he comes to accept and understand his daughter. Borat is the last place I'd expect such a feel good storyline, but here we are anyway.

                        Fourteen years ago Sacha Baron Cohen was largely introduced to the world via the titular Borat Sagdiyev. Borat - a man who by happenstance makes Americans look as idiotic as they perceive him to be - was born into a world and a country at a point in time (or maybe at a point in my life) where the world was maybe not less complicated, but certainly less chaotic. At that point in time, the revelations Borat came across in his ""Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" were known, but not explicit. Did racism still exist? Sure, but it was mostly our grandpas who were halfway out the door anyway - or so we thought. In Borat Subsequent Moviefilm Cohen wears a Ku Klux Klan outfit into a Conservative conference and the most shocking part is how many people seemingly in attendance are also shocked by this. This also signals the main downfall of a decade and a half later Borat sequel as hardly anything is genuinely shocking anymore. I mean, when the President of the United States has had an affair with a porn star the fact the former mayor of New York City is totally up for getting it on with a hot, young reporter during a global pandemic isn't exactly surprising. 

That doesn't mean Cohen's antics are no longer funny as I laughed plenty - the genuine investment in our hero's plight by his new-found quarantine friends is hysterical - and Cohen hasn't lost the ability to push all the wrong buttons in just the right context either. Some of the edge is also lost in the fact Cohen can no longer exist as the character of Borat as widely or as boldly as he could prior to 2006. In this regard, largely unknown Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova will come away as the one who gets most of the kudos as her anonymity and status as a young woman help the film to expose America's deep-rooted sexism (get ready for a debutante dance for the ages) among other things (fake news!). And so, while Borat Subsequent Moviefilm may not be as initially outrageous as its predecessor or even equally as funny it certainly feels more necessary and by virtue of that necessity, all the more urgent.

                        I don't usually appreciate shock humor, but this was cathartic for me given the year we just lived through. Definitely outshines the first movie, and Maria Bakalova was amazing at her role.

                        Though I would not recommend this film for those under their teens; Sacha Cohen deserves  his two Golden Globes for best film and best actor -- just for his bravery to make it!  It is not a true comedy, but rather a parody on the misconceptions about America -- from within and outside the USA. A do not miss for thinking adults . . . .

                        I agree that this subsequent moviefilm doesn't reach its former glory. I think it originally was meant to focus on Trump but they eventually adapted to the pandemic situation and included this topic as well, which per se made access to public figures even more difficult. It's still a movie worth watching if you like Cohan and its previous moviefilm for the glorious nation of Kazakhstan.

                        The outrageous, in-your-face, unexpected shock value humor that characterized this film's predecessor never really impressed me much, and that's largely true here, too. However, this long-awaited sequel has its moments of inspired comedic tastelessness that make the picture something of a modest guilty pleasure, the kind of picture you watch in private, under the covers in your bedroom, lit up by the glow of your portable video device. Some of the novelty is gone now that audiences know the formula that makes the production work, and the audacity that fueled its predecessor somehow doesn't seem quite as comically appalling in an age where we have pervasive social media posts whose sentiments are even more vile than the content presented here. But, when Sacha Baron Cohen and company hit on an inventive gag that works, it really works, in some cases generating laughs even heartier than those that came out of the first film. The biggest gem here is the addition of Maria Bakalova as the protagonist's daughter, who provides some much-needed oomph to the overall tone of the film, delivering a hilarious performance deserving of all the accolades and award nominations she has received. Still, given the state of culture and society these days, it may be time to put the Borat franchise to rest; we don't need any more fuel splashed on the fire, no matter how well-intentioned it might be as biting political commentary -- we have enough of that already, and it's not very funny any more.

                        Sasha Baron Cohen, imprisoned for bringing shame to Kazakhstan and which is I think probably how the last movie ended, in exchange for a trip to America to restore the honor of the country. When he gets to America, he finds that his daughter has stowed away, and the two of them embark on a mission to get her married to Mike Pence (at least I think this is how the story went). Some parts of the movie were funny in illuminating issues of cultural difference and what our political system probably looks like from an outsider. However, I found the film more tedious as it went on. I never did watch the first one, and having seen this sequel, I have retained my conviction that it isn't worth losing two valuable hours of my life to watch it. While I am sure there is an audience for this kind of humor, it just really isn't my kind of movie. I give it a tenuous thumbs up, but not a tremendous endorsement. My guess is that if you liked the first one, you probably would like this one as well.

It’s stupid, but the fact they couldn’t get the capitol of Kazakhstan correct bugged me Yes, I know it’s a parody film and wasn’t filmed at all in Kazakhstan, but they could have at least gotten that detail right. Other than that it was the typical Hollywood. Republicans are racist, anti woman, anti-semite troupe that has been overdone way too much.

                        Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel that is clever in how it works around Sacha Baron Cohen's own heightened fame, as well as in how it writes around real-world events. Cohen is as shocking, shameless, brave and brilliant as ever, but it's Maria Baklova, playing Borat's daughter, who steals the whole damn show. Mike Pence made a big mistake turning down a gift like that.

                        This was an absolutely horrible movie.  It lacks any type of creativity beyond Cohen's typical shtick of making fun of poor people who show him generosity.  In typical 2020 fashion, the political minutiae of the film will have all of the ""experts"" drooling, while providing next to no comedic value.  But Cohen really doesn't care about that.  That's not what this film is for.

                        He thought of little new in his simplistic style- make situations with strangers sexual and/or creepy and extremely awkward(as well as keep on insulting and mocking Kazakhstan culture and its people with exaggerations and outright ignorant misinformation ).  Which gets old fast and incredibly dumb. Lots of pretty ballsy non-scripted pranks he goes into with the actual Rep. party and supporters that takes guts. But as usual,  next to no real life pranks or pokes on Dems or the party are seen in the film. I could care less about either but Sacha Baron Cohen bias does show pretty clearly. Some events are clearly scripted and previously planned and the ""victims"" are in on it, which does take away much of the fun . But some are mostly pure if not fully. Others are moronic and disturbing like the dance exposing period blood soaked panties, which i shook my head at rather than laugh.   A lot of video editing is done clearly to much of the public footage at points to make things different than they appear ( like in the Rudy G one and others ). Humour was hit or miss throughout for me. Its just a silly movie that is partially scripted in many of its pranks. Far away from the sucess of the 1st one. Nothing legendary nor impactful here folks just a similiar production designed with ""shock"" value .

                        Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) does it again with Borat 2. From the title to the last second, this movie is filled with comedic gold. The first Borat film came out in 2006, 14 years ago from the time of this review, and what a time to receive this follow up. Sacha passes the flame to himself in this sequel and perfectly pulls off the role that made him a household name. This film brings Borat further character development, especially with the introduction of his daughter, and tackles some of Americas biggest political problems. Filled with ignorant rednecks and corrupt politicians, if you enjoyed Borat the first time around, you'll definitely enjoy this one, maybe even more... 5/5 stars. 

P.S. the twist at the end is spectacular.

                        CAGEY DAUGHTER

Fourteen years on, the return of Borat seems a bit odd if not redundant. What could possibly be left on the U.S. Barbie to skewer after four years of this mind numbing, reality altering, apocalyptic shit show? Flush.

And yet here he is, and here we are. Never underestimate Sacha Baron Cohen. Too recognizable to punk, Borat slips into absurd disguises to go about his sneaky business, and it is deviously glorious. Easy pickings, true, the far right remains a gullible, silly, scary and incomprehensible lot, but we, the converted being preached to, know all that. Fox News exists damn it! Much like an engrossing nature program revealing odd secrets of an exotic species, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is an eye popping, enlightening, voyeuristic peep show, without the David Attenborough narrative.

The greatest subversion Borat achieves is not the fish in the barrel Republican dupes, but the full freaking' frontal assault on outdated gender values revealed through his cagey daughter's adventures. The thrilling dread of the Fertility Dance at a debutante ball is cringeworthy gold and the look away, can't look, gotta look, centrepiece of the film. You know what is coming. You will be scared. You will hide your eyes. You will groan. You will gasp. You will laugh. You will shudder. It will be seared into movie memory.

Much like the original, the sequel dives into waters few dare wade, amassing a series of skit style episodes exposing a bizarre American underbelly, scary and funny in equal overdoses. What this film adds to the table is an actual story line: a sweet relationship of discovery between a father and his female born son, and most importantly, her spirited dismantling of rigid patriarchal values. Maria Bakalova as Tutar steals the show, in a startlingly realistic, brave and earnest portrayal beside the clownish Borat.

So a movie that puts women in cages is actually a feminist manifesto? Um, yup. Also, capturing Rudy Giuliani fiddling with his junk is a Hollywood Oscar moment of grand infamy.

Excite!

                        4 out of 5 stars. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is another satirical mockumentary that brings back Borat who travels to America with his daughter Tatur ( Maria Bakalova) to give her to Mike Pence as a gift. Sure the plot crosses a lot of controversy and very raunchy with racist jokes. Sexist. And so much more. If you love raunchy dirty jokes. This film is filled with a lot of it. The cast is great. Sasha Baron Cohen is entertaining as Borat. Maria Bakalova is a fun addition.

Maybe Borat 2 should be classified as horror. It was an absolute kill of time with nothing consequential to think about. The movie didn't want to be recognised with its predecessor that it came in a disguise of a satire.  NOT!

                        I think I like this one just a bit more than the original. It's a fantastic commentary on America in 2020 and has a lot of really funny scenes. Bakalova certainly steals the show in this as she's fantastic.

Wouldn't it be nice if he could take just one token shot at the other side, but I guess he knows who is buttering his bread.

Besides that it was a cringeworthy film with few genuinely funny moments.  The irony is Cohen and his crew with their base antics, sink below the level of the people they lampoon.

                        Woefully lazy and incredibly unfunny sequel to Baron Cohen's first outing as Borat. Quite literally, not a single laugh - which is an achievement of sorts, I suppose. His obsession with punching low and finding any opportunity to get his dick out is beyond tedious. Here he also relishes endless vagina and menstruation sequences. It'd be boring during student rag week, but in a flashy big budget Hollywood vehicle it's toe-curling. Truly dire.

                        It's hard to pull off unique, US-skewering satire in 2020. In 2006, we laughed at the shock of Borat's reveal of the America's soul. Now with Facebook, YouTube, iPhones, countless talk shows & pundit panels, & Donald Trump, it's hard to surprise us. Smartly, BSMF seems aware of this & leans heavier into the narrative, which provides the biggest shock: how sweet the story is! Maria Bakalova is a revelation & basically carries the movie. SIDE NOTE: the dance scene is far more insane than the Giuliani one.

Rather than appropriately confront controversial topics, Sacha Baron Cohen chooses to instead widen public divides without so much as a chuckle.

It's clever satire and character development makes for a worthwhile watch! Although, the comedic formula of the first film doesn't quite reach the same heights in this instalment -it's makes up in being relevant tapping into modern day issues. Borat? BoRATE highly.

                        “Finally the time had come to deliver my daughter to the vice p*ssy-grabber.” It wasn’t till last week that I actually saw Borat. Those types of movies just never really interested me, but I thought it might be time to see what all the fuss was about. I guess I understand now. It’s funny and all well done I just don’t think it’s as amazing as everyone else does. That being said, this one became necessary for me to see after the first. This must be the year for relevant movies. I’m honestly shocked at how many topics they covered. And they’re all done well. With the addition of Maria Bakalova they could achieve so much more with not only topics but also recognition with acting. When I tell you she could actually go let an Oscar nomination I’m not joking in the slightest. I’m just as surprised as everyone else it. When I saw her name come in the top ten actress contenders I didn’t understand why. But wow! She took her role to a whole new level. As good as Sacha Baron Cohen is as Borat, he’s overshadowed by Bakalova. The first act really had me thinking this was better than the first. Again with the topics the covered, the execution is done so well. Whether it’s a comical or serious situation there’s wonderful recognition to each subject. At the halfway point it seemed they did all they could. The movie slumps down there into just an ok movie. Towards the end of the third act it does pick up but never to the level of greatness that is the first act. This is a pretty straightforward movie. It’s absolutely hilarious and a great time. I don’t have much else to say but I think this is a fun movie and would recommend it to anyone who can handle vulgar humor or just anyone who loves a good comedy.

                        Surprisingly exceeded all my expectations!

The first movie felt a little too ""stupid"" for me, so I was slightly hesitant to watch the second one but am glad I did. It was satirical, funny, original, entertaining and not TOO ridiculous.

After watching ""The Spy"", my respect for Sacha Baron Cohen skyrocketed because I realized he is an extremely multi-dimensional characters. Everything he does as Borat is legitimate acting and takes skill; he's not just being himself.

Trying to distinguish which parts of the movie were real and which parts were fully owned by actors were an entertaining and difficult exercise. MOST of the scenes were very real, so it's actually astounding the type of footage he was able to get. He caught Rudy Giuliani being okay with accepting sexual favors and got a few Republicans to admit thinking that Democarts are daemons. 

Also, anyone who speaks multiple languages (I know Russian and Hebrew) realizes the second-level meta jokes. Borat speaks a weird mix of Tatar & Hebrew to hist daughter, and his daughter speaks in Bulgarian back to him. Anyone who only knows english would have never figured this out, but it made the whole film so much more ridiculous.

                        I think I actually liked this better than the first Borat. Sure, the first one was very original at the time and might have had more of a cultural impact, but this one actually has some heart and a little more of a message. The humor is spot on, as expected, but it's hard not to feel like this movie just came at a very lucky time to be writing satire. The political impact and risk is hard to ignore as it makes the ""fictional"" story bleed into the real world. Sacha Baron Cohen's ability to improvise and stay in character makes this an incredibly entertaining film.

                        Sacha Baron Cohen is a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude. Here is my review of Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm!

From an American man giving a Nazi salute to politicians having to tweet out in defence of their disgusting actions, Borat is BACK! Though not as funny as the original, this one still has its moments of hilariously cringey and offensive humour. I also ended up liking Borat's daughter, Tutar, more than I thought I would. She holds her own alongside Borat, and it was fun watching their relationship grow. But what this movie does brilliantly is that it takes this sh*t year of 2020 and uses it as a plot device, which makes this movie more relevant than ever.

However, since Borat has become extremely recognizable following the original, Sacha Baron Cohen had to use other disguises to disguise Borat. At which point, it felt less like a Borat movie and more of Sacha Baron Cohen, a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude. This movie also focused more on the story and less on the laughs, which would have been better had the story been more original. But at the end of the day, this movie's goal was to make me laugh, and it did that well enough, but not as well as the first.

Score: 7 out of 10
Overall: ""Very nice!""

Recommended for: Fans of Sacha Baron Cohen, fans of father/daughter stories, or fans of discovering the truth behind COVID-19.

                        Okay, the first Borat was controversial, sparked some processes, but its 2020 sequence will likely have many, many more processes. Without a doubt Sacha Baron Cohen is a brave person. 14 years after the events of the first film Borat is sent back to the United States, but this time with a different purpose and alongside his daughter. We waited 14 years for a sequel to the first feature, and was it worth it? the answer is yes! It was very worth it Borat 2020 presents the same kind of humor as the first film which is great, again a very good performance by Sacha Baron Cohen and most importantly: extremely heavy criticisms of the American lifestyle and the Trump administration, which is undoubtedly the point highest in the film. Perhaps anyone who is not fully familiar with current US policy will not understand one or the other joke, but you can have fun just the same. At certain moments in the film you will find yourself asking: What is this? How hasn't Sacha Baron Cohen been arrested yet ?? And this is just amazing. But obviously not everything in the film is wonderful, it presents some problems of the first film, as things are resolved very easily and happen very fast, for me the first Borat (2007) is still better, but the second feature manages to honor the first well. Borad (2020) is a great film, even though it is not perfect and a little inferior than the first, it is a great sequel and a very funny comedy film, with heavy criticisms and pertinent to the USA.

                        With all the screenplay writers returning with a small squadron of capable backups, the sequel to Borat is in excellent hands. True, I didn't think the first one was very good, but with THE STORY of the century as its guideline and a wonderful performance by Maria Bakalova, Borat strikes gold.
Just throw in Sacha Baron Cohen's gift for setting people up as perfect marks and you have a the makings of what is possibly the best comedy sequel ever made.

Also, despite its incredibly raunchy ridiculousness, the movie boasts a surprisingly wholesome center. It's a fun follow-up film overall, one for which quality was not squandered for the sake of the character's popularity.

                        Borat is released from prison 14 years after bringing shame to his country.  He is then offered a chance at redemption by delivering Kazakh Minister of Culture Johnny the Monkey to President Trump.  However, after an unfortunate incident befalls Johnny, he instead decides to offer his 15 year old daughter to Vice President Mike Pence.  So begins his trip across America again in the hope of making his delivery and saving his country's national pride.
What I loved about the first movie was the unsuspecting victims knew nothing about Borat and they were given enough rope to embarrass and shame themselves with their bigoted, narrow minded and far right views.   This obviously wasn't going to happen this time around considering how much press the movie received originally.  Sacha Baron Cohen addresses this obvious issue himself fairly early on and we witness him being chased by Borat fans and seeking out a suitable disguise..  So now we have Sacha Baron Cohen disguised as Borat who is then again disguised as various other characters throughout the film.  The main issue is these other characters just aren't as funny or hold as much interest as Borat.  It all felt a bit forced and staged this time around.  I know most of the reactions of the people he encountered were real but a number of the scenarios were staged and those involved were prewarned. This isn't the case with all the set pieces and there are still some genuine laughs and hide behind your fingers moments but overall it wasn't a patch on the first movie.

                        ""Borat 2"" is a film much more mature and aware of what it wants to do than its predecessor, we even have a very well constructed social criticism, with characters who suffer from ailments and have doubts about their development and personality, everything is very well explored behind a curtain of a black, slapstick and absurd mood but that still works very well, it works out that ""Borat 1"" is funnier, but the sequence has its moments.

It would be difficult to imagine borat nowadays, a film that has a humorous charge that today is not so well socially accepted, the solution was to satirize the right people so as not to suffer from severe criticism or boycotts, a wise move to build narrative.

The film has a simple but effective direction, many loose cameras, use of natural lighting, with extremely organic short shots, although the film does not feel the same shockumentary as the first, its transgression still works. the actors look great, Sacha Baron delivers a convincing and fun borat and bilak sagdiyev surprises with a multi-layered performance.

""Borat 2"" is a fun movie, with an acid, mature script and that even has several Plots, with a great conclusion, here we have a bunch of ideas that are organized and that work very differently from the first, even if the sequence has less charm, it is still an interesting film and that preaches a humor that is needed nowadays. 7/10

The extreme ""cultural misogyny stereotypes"" of Borat's daughter is set up as deep satire but misses the mark with its repetitive and over-the-top offering.  There's a few moments which have been popularly discussed as they are relevant to the time of its release - references to COVID-19 and footage of politicians in the 2020 Presidential Election campaign. Save yourself the trouble and time of watching it - just catch the clips on YouTube of Pence & Rudy Giuliani getting pranked.

There's a certain reaction that comes with the element of surprise--and that reaction was present in none of the faces of the actors. They clear anticipated the punch-lines, which wouldn't have been funny even if they were spontaneous. Jeff Bezos paid millions for the production of this hastily-shot, COVID lockdown era film because of his personal vendetta with Trump. I get it, you can hate the guy, but don't make all of us suffer as a consequence Borat is dead, rest in irrelevancy.

                        Like a cheap wine, the movie starts strong and finishes poorly. The intro is slow and boring. The next 35 minutes or so are quite funny and reminiscent of the original. At around 45 minutes in, the movie bogs down and devolves into pure partisan hackery and hatred for the US. That would be fine if it was funny, but the movie derails into the cringeworthy, and not in a good way. I am still trying to finish the movie, as in one attempt I fell asleep, and the other I got so bored I ended up playing mobile games. 

All in all, probably not worth the watch. I'm all for political jokes on anyone, if they're funny. Borat 2 takes a long detour from funny about halfway through.

                        The second Borat film isn’t as funny as the first film some of the shock factor is gone but if you’re looking for crude laughs it’s still a very funny film. The film takes a lot of political jabs and even on your political views it can still be funny. There’s a lot of creative writing here and jokes that work although the movie is very in the moment. 10-15 years from now it probably won’t have much affect as everybody would’ve forgotten about the election. If you’re a Borat fan it’s a very funny film just not as good as the first.

                        Funny as usual, the movie was hurt only by the expectation of what it could achieve. Getting Rudy in that position, and showing the underbelly of Republicans were both great but it could have gotten more deep, more controversial and more SBC. Somehow, I feel they held back. I don't know if it was due to the pandemic, or due to budget or due to fear, but I expected more from him.

                        The sequel to Sacha Baron Cohen's original Borat film is quite timely, with McDonald Trump on the brink of defeat. Much more silly storyline than actual encounters with real people being fooled, but still very well done. Especially touching were the scenes with the woman hired to be his daughter's babysitter, and at the synagogue with the elderly Jewish women. The Period Dance was probably the most memorable part of the movie. Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova does a fantastic job as Tutar.

                        These films are way better than they have any right to be - entirely thanks to Sacha Baron Cohen.

I enjoyed 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' more than its predecessor from 2006, which relied too heavily on shock sex humour for my liking - though I did still like it all in all. This sequel is a little more creative with its jokes, whilst still having the necessary silliness and cringe.

Cohen is excellent as he reprises the role of Borat. He made me laugh a number of times, any other actor in this role simply wouldn't be funny - he somehow makes it work expertly, his perfect delivery being crucial.

In the first film, Cohen had Ken Davitian alongside him. Davitian doesn't return which is a shame, but he isn't missed to be honest. Maria Bakalova steps in very well, I feared her Tutar character was going to be irritating but she's anything but - Bakalova holds her own alongside Cohen.

It's amusing, in ways that are indeed funny but also in ways that you know you shouldn't be laughing at - though that's critical to these films working. It also has the same Punk'd feel that the original production has.

Good satire.

                        It was funny. I don't want to give anything away, but yeah, it was really funny. Borat's daughter is amazing and it was mildly topical. I laughed a lot. The only people who wouldn't like this film are White American Christian Patriots who take themselves seriously, or people who want to relive their first introduction to Borat. It's not as shocking as the 1st movie, doesn't have any of the hilarious gross-out scenes, and it isn't rocket science, but it's still funny.

                        Cohen gets people to reveal the silliness of their hatred and fear just by getting them to be themselves around him. I heard that he uses a traditional clowning style to make Borat a kind of innocent fool. That makes him approachable to the people he wants to ridicule. He learned this technique, I understand, from Philippe Gaulier's clown school. Maria Bakalova delivers a fine performance as Borat's daughter.

                        Hello from Russia! I love Cohen's work. Such a comedian is the only one in the whole world. To make fun of people who think that the grotesque country I have invented really exists. Where gay men wear blue berets, women sit in cages, everyone drinks horse urine and the age of consent is nine. You must be able to do this! Cohen shows that behind a fake smile and ""education"" behind this whole screen are the same uneducated people living in stereotypes, which makes them no better than the people who live in this ""grotesque country of Kazakhstan"". This film really gives people the thought that they need to change. Works like this film are rare. A fan of Marvel films will not understand the depth of this film.
 WARNING SPOILER! I especially liked how Kazakhstan sent Borat to the Gulag and with his help is trying to take revenge on the world. This is really funny. Reflects how Kazakhs react to this film.
PS: I hope Cohen will come back to us more than once in a similar manner and bring us many more films. It is worth saying that during the filming of the first and second parts, Cohen was exposed to the fact that he could be shot. Indeed, a person is ready for a lot for the sake of art! Thank you Sasha Cohen, we love you in Russia!

                        This works so well as a comedy, satire and social commentary. We cannot expect this to be as good as the first, but as the summary of the end of Trump and Covid infested year of 2020 this does a perfect job. Not only is it funny but at times touching. Sasha Baron Cohen is famous for making people uncomfortable in all his films, he does it here too. However Borat 2 also manages to have some really touching scenes centering around normal Americans and the man himself trying to save himself and his daughter. Borat creates a hilarious comparison between America in 2020 and Kazakhstan, he acts fantastically but the real reactions of the victims of his satire take this film to another level.

It's hard to believe it's been nearly a decade and a half since the original ""Borat"" (2006) arrived in theaters, smack dab in the middle of George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States, and just prior to the midterm elections. I remember that time distinctly because I was hoping the ""ugly side of America"" that ""Borat"" revealed would incite people to question and evaluate their values, especially if those values justified discriminating against or preemptively judging other people. And if they did, perhaps they'd be prompted to vote for leaders at the highest levels of government that didn't subscribe to or condone such myopic ways of thinking.

OK, clearly I was naïve, because I highly doubt a small movie such as ""Borat"" had that kind of influence on viewers' political persuasions, as there were obviously much greater factors at play that allowed the Democrats to take control of both houses of Congress that year. Still, I'd like to think if someone was on the fence about which way to vote, perhaps watching ""Borat"" might have pushed him or her toward the more progressive side. As chaotic a time as 2006 was, it was also tame enough that a film like ""Borat"" (its raunchy and scatological humor aside) could be viewed as bold, shocking and useful because it got us to maybe see what was wrong with us as a people and illustrated just how irrational we can sometimes think and behave.

Now comes the sequel, aptly titled, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,"" and while it has the same noble intentions as its predecessor, it's unfortunately (and probably inevitably) not as fresh, not to mention funny. However, that's not to say it isn't still useful, but more on that in a bit.

As a mockumentary that seeks to shock and entertain by once again having writer-producer-star Sacha Baron Cohen dress up and assume the identity of fictitious Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev in order to prank unsuspecting, real-life individuals—as a way to exemplify not only the absurdity of what Borat says and does but also the absurd way unassuming people sometimes react—the movie is a victim of its time. In 2020, we're already well into an era in which absurdity is the new normal, and so much of the movie feels less like a brazen and uproarious comedy and more like a daily newscast that doesn't tell us anything terribly new or interesting. We're used to people acting and reacting outrageously.

This isn't to undermine director Jason Woliner or Baron Cohen's efforts, because I still sensed their underlying energy and dedication to the material. But as comedians and satirists, I wish they had chosen different ideologies to lampoon and public figures to target, or perhaps narrowed them down a bit. As staunch leftists themselves, they predictably go after right wing politics; conservatism; patriarchy; racial and ethnic stereotyping; white supremacy; sexism; fake news; preposterous conspiracy theories; the mishandling of global pandemics, etc. And, by extension, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Jeffrey Epstein, Rudy Giuliani, etc.

I'm not saying all of these notions and people don't deserve to be mocked, but they are already so ubiquitous and so ridiculous just by being what and who they are that any effort to call more attention to them or make fun of them feels like an exercise in futility and a waste of good resources. Believe it or not, there are other things happening in the world, so why give them more coverage? At several points throughout the movie, when my wife reacted to what was happening on-screen by exclaiming, ""Ugh!"" ""That's awful!"" or ""Oh, my God!,"" my response was, ""Are you really that surprised?"" In other words, most of the ugliness ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" uncovers is expected and par for the course, which initially made me wonder, what is the point of the movie?

Then, a few days after watching it, it dawned on me: Maybe the shock value of ""Moviefilm"" is that it isn't shocking. Maybe what Woliner and Baron Cohen wanted to show was that neither the people in it nor the viewers watching it are all that startled by what happens or the words that come out peoples' mouths, no matter their political or religious beliefs. And therein lies the problem: we've all become so numb and desensitized to extreme people, behavior and practices that we just sort of accept them as they are, without question, when we should really be speaking up and questioning everything.

Take, for instance, one scene during which Borat heads to a farm equipment store to buy an animal cage. He tells the salesman the cage will be used for his daughter. The salesman hears this but appears not think much of the idea and, from what I gather, that it's even normal since the Trump Administration has essentially ""caged"" families in detention centers along the U.S.-Mexico border. 

In another scene, Borat asks a baker to write out ""Jews will not replace us"" in frosting on a chocolate cake, echoing the chant by white supremacists in Charlottesville, VA in 2017. The baker, simply fulfilling her customer's request, proceeds to do just that and doesn't even think to refuse or protest.

The movie is filled with many other apathetic reactions to arguably ludicrous and reprehensible behavior, and even though such tepid responses aren't surprising, they're still appalling. Have we all gotten this complacent, lazy and/or scared to express ourselves directly about things we inherently know to be immoral? Sure, we can Tweet, post and write movie reviews, but what happened to speaking our minds in person? The movie awakens us to the idea it's wrong we've become so jaded and lethargic when it comes to the persecution of other people and that too often we simply let things slide. In fact, it jumpstarts us to act like human beings again, and we draw inspiration, for instance, from Jeanise Jones, a black babysitter in the film who isn't afraid to voice her thoughts about women deserving self-respect and respect from others. On this level, ""Moviefilm"" has a veritable purpose.

As a comedy and pure entertainment, however, it's not as effective. This is a shame, too, because Borat the character, in spite of his ignorance and impropriety, is still so innocent and loveable, and so we wish he had found himself in a more inspired screenplay. Cohen and his fellow seven writers once again blend the mockumentary gags with a goofy side plot that turns out to be a mostly dull and frivolous distraction.

The ""plot"" picks up 14 years after the first film when Borat is serving a life sentence of hard labor in a gulag for humiliating his home country. Kazakhstan's Premier (Dani Popescu) tells him he can go free if he successfully completes a mission to deliver Johnny the Monkey, the country's Minister of Culture, to Donald Trump as a gift, in hopes that Trump will use his pull and celebrity to reclaim respect to the nation.

Of course, zany people and circumstances ensue and inevitably disrupt Borat's plans, not least Borat learning he has a ""non-son,"" which is to say he has a daughter. Her name is Tutar (Maria Bakalova), who's 15 and has been brought up to believe her only purpose as a female is to keep quiet and please men. Nevertheless, she's curious about the world and she stows away to America to join her father. 

Without giving too much away, Tutar takes the place of Johnny the Monkey and becomes the intended gift to Mike Pence and then to Rudy Giuliani. As Borat and Tutar embark on a cross-country tour to get her ready, they encounter a range of real-life people, places and events that serve as the punchlines for the movie's jokes, including CPAC; an anti-abortion pastor; fathers and daughters at a debutante ball; an Instagram influencer; a plastic surgery clinic; QAnon conspiracy theorists; and one or two of the political figues I mentioned above.

Because we've already been down this road with the first ""Borat"" and can essentially anticipate what will happen given its familiar structure, the setups and reactions from people don't have the same punchy impact they once did. Most of the time we watch ""Moviefilm"" knowing what it's going to do ahead of time and then simply watch it do it. All the while, in the back of our minds, we're hoping it will catch us off guard and try something different.

It never really does though, and I know the point of a movie like this isn't to tell an original or involving story, but I still wish Woliner and Baron Cohen had found a way to make the plot and gags less predictable. There were times when they even seemed desperate to get a visceral reaction out of us. I'm not saying the site of someone stuffing their face with a cupcake and accidentally eating a plastic baby, or bloody genitals, or a half-naked man wearing a strap-on dildo can't be funny when done right and unexpectedly, but here they're mostly gross and, frankly, stupid.

Because ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" strives to be a comedy first, and its humor falls mostly flat, I can't justifiably recommend it overall. However, its political and humanitarian messages are worth hearing. As silly and vulgar as the movie is on the outside, it sincerely encourages us to remember it's never too late to seek, learn or speak the truth; to make an effort to really listen to someone else's perspective; and to not pass judgment on anyone or anything before we have the requisite knowledge. I'm wise enough to know the movie isn't likely to change anyone's vote, at least not right away, but I'm hopeful it will resonate with people and remind us to speak kindly and, if need be, assertively to one another in person so that we can more effectively help one another out of any absurd time we may find ourselves in, maybe even bring the absurdity levels down a bit . I think we'd all be better off if we could once again consider the things Borat says and does to be shocking and outrageous instead of normal and then have the courage to call him out on it.

                        It is so not PC, and outrageously sarcastic and satirical. It makes fun of itself and in this political time that was fun.  NOT for everyone and once warned, if you are offended easily, do not watch, but if you can take stuff with a grain of salt, it is laughable!

                        I like to think of myself as pretty easy to please when it comes to movies. However Borat 2 is so bad that I wasn’t even able to make it half way through the movie. Very little creativity went into this movie and it just wasn’t funny unlike the first movie. It also didn’t help that this movie was so focused on bashing the Trump administration. Probably should have focused more on a new plot instead of just taking the first movie and basically changing lines. Again no creativity. Why in the world is this movie rated as good as it is!?

                        If you loved the first one than you are likely to enjoy this one. It is not as funny or engaging as the original Borat, and if you are more of a conservative voter you are likely to enjoy this even less. If you happen to enjoy the comedy of late night hosts, than you are likely to enjoy this film. 
The premise is simple, as it is only a Borat movie, but there are some interesting twists. Adding a secondary character to push the movie along in the form of Borat's daughter was undoubtable necessary as the character of Borat alone would make this movie an utter flop. Unfortunately, since Borat and his daughter require each other to make this movie worth watching, there are two major problems that the movie encounters.
1. When Borat is no longer with his daughter the plot of the film falls apart, yet in an ironic twist, it is much closer to the style of the original Borat and was enjoyable. Yet, when the two are simultaneously in play, the quality of the humor drops significantly.
2. The daughter being 'in' on the joke the entire time makes most of the jokes seem much more forced than in the original mockumentary in which Cohen was taking the piss out of Americans. 
While there are certainly times that were funny, there were a lot of jokes that were unironically off and instead was akin to someone picking on the fat kid at the playground. 
Slightly better than Bruno, worse than the other Cohen movies.

                        Wasn't very funny to me. It basically revealed that some dudes are real creeps around women, but that's hardly groundbreaking news. Maybe it would've been good if that was the focus of the movie instead of tying so hard to shock people by being ridiculous or gross. The problem for me was that it took substantially absurd lengths to shock people, if they did at all. By that point it breaks the suspension of disbelief and you just see actors being rude to try to get some sort of reaction. Perhaps the restrictions of Coronavirus lockdowns limited the ability for this to be a good movie, or maybe it was never going to come together.

                        This movie has a lot to say about politics, sexism, and propaganda. Sure, some of it is silly, but it's more than made up for by the incredibly bold moments that are just sublime. Sacha Baron Cohen has certainly met his match in the young actress who plays his daughter, who proves herself to be just as unflinching in unnerving situations as he is.

Finally, it is very, very timely film, so if you plan to see it, better now than later.

                        Hot on the heels of his showy dramatic turn in The Trial of the Chicago 7, Sacha Baron Cohen has secretly resuscitated his old alter-ego for a sequel that is as timely as it is fearless. Subtitled: ""Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", thus produced a singular narrative arc on which Cohen and his team set out to prank America again. Following the international success of his first film which made him and his country a laughing stock, a shamed and banished Borat is given an opportunity to redeem himself by travelling in disguise back to the US with a gift for Donald Trump. If his ugly truths and prejudices confronting stunts don't feel quite as fresh and original this time round, the skills and balls required to pull them off are as incredibly impressive as ever. Major kudos to Cohen and his new accomplice, 24-years-old Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova as Borat's 15-year-old daughter Tutar, who brazenly and bravely put themselves in ridiculous and often ridiculously dangerous situations for our entertainment, be it dressed as Trump making a ruckus at a Conservative Political Action Conference; flashing a 'moon blood' soaked underdress at a debutant ball or living with 2 QAnon rednecks in character for 5 days. There's no denying its political urgency and coherency (timed deliberately to be released pre-US Election) and manages not only to skewer the Trump administration but also throw a few -ism's such as sexism, racism and anti-Semitism in for good measure. It may be a bit patchy but when it hits, it does so spectacularly, especially the sections with Pastor Jonathan Bright and Rudy Giuliani, which will leave you jaw-dropped in incredulity. There's even a wicked sting of an ending that cannot be more 2020. Very nice, indeed.

They were set up to expose something about the other person, but they were largely not terribly convincing and a little forced.  Many of these scenes had been released online prior to the films release.  The staged/scripted scenes appeared to be patchwork after the fact to string it all into a somewhat coherent story.  The climax was the Rudy G. scene, which is not convincing in trying to paint him as a predator (I am not a Rudy G. fan, but...).  It did pass the time, but not the genius work we expect from Sasha Cohen.

                        The first ""Borat"" is one of the most offensive and ridiculous comedic satires out there. This sequel delivers a lot of similar humor that fans of the first should enjoy. Sacha Baron Cohen has always been someone I greatly admire because he truly has no fear when it comes to comedic boundaries. The movie is a bit too politically charged to be as memorable as the first, but I still think the commentary is pretty smart. The movie has a great first half and an insane ending, but it does have some less impactful segments in the middle. There are enough laughs in the movie, but I think the first is a bit more consistent and timeless. Overall, while it is completely clear why this movie was made and released now, I still think it is an entertaining and outrageous movie with plenty of laugh out loud moments.

                        While it's hard to believe it was so many years ago when Sascha Baron Cohen first dropped Borat on our laps, causing audiences all over the world to cringe and crumple in their theater seats. It would also be nice to believe that we as a society have evolved past this type of gross out humor.

It would also be wrong because Borat:Subsequent Moviefilm is still impossible to tear your eyes away from.

As if the plot matters at all, our protagonist (?) has to travel to America to bribe Vice President Mike Pence with his daughter to restore the glory of his home Kazakhstan. If not he'll be executed. Along the way, he'll have to learn more lessons about the United States in order to make his journey a success.

This movie is ridiculous and irreverent, but you shouldn't be surprised this time around. If you're easily offended stay away.

Cohen's humor once again hits it's audience like a speeding truck even when we know it's coming. When we think it's gone too far, it curses at you and takes it even further. One thing that time has done is make us forget that these Borat films don't care what the collateral damage is when delivering it's laughs. It's shocking and it will either make you laugh or make you cover your eyes. Probably both.

I can almost guarantee you. You will not be bored here. Maria Bakalova also doesn't miss a step as Borat's equally clueless daughter.

The film's original magic is gone and you do have to suspend your belief a little here, and the third act does drag a little, but the if you're familiar with the Borat product you should be pretty happy.

                        What you have to respect about Sacha Baron Cohen is through all the absurd comedy there are always moments of the good side of humanity.  

Of coarse there are plenty moments of our ugly souls on display also.

                        I enjoyed the first movie. This second movie was anxiously awaited and it was terrible. It is a terrible movie that is distasteful and not clever. It is as much a satire on societies morals as it is about the morals of Sacha Baron Cohen. Many of the scenes nefariously set-up unwitting participants to be in uncomfortable situations which no one would want to be in and are frankly grossly distasteful and difficult to manage. I am left wondering why someone would scheme to abuse media to try and deface another, yet they have no accountability themselves for luring unethical behavior. For shame. Save your time and don’t watch this garbage.

                        It's not a very entertaining film. It's simply about mocking others. Not something I find entertaining. I watched the first one as well...mainly because I'm recovering from surgery and have nothing else to do, and it wasn't really any better, but at least it was original. It's relatively clear that this ""mockumentary"" is primarily intended to mock and discredit a particular segment of the American political scene. To be fair, sneaking into venues and getting actual footage of some of the political characters was promising, and could have been interesting, but felt forced and poorly executed. I don't even know why I watched until the end. I guess I'm just in that much pain that anything on the tv screen was better than nothing. IMO, trying to get a laugh at the expense of others is the lowest form of comedy, like the shock jocks who make fun of their audience.

One final observation, the use of human trafficking as a sort of comedy prop was disturbing. Slavery is very real in the modern day and isn't funny. Young women primarily and some young men are bought and sold every day, and while this film could have exposed the evils of human trafficking, they just turn it around at the end to be boys sold into slavery instead of girls. 

The film falls flat.

                        Borat 2 has the tough task of attempting to catch lightning in the bottle twice. The film runs a few of the old jokes that don't float as well but this film manages some very funny set pieces. The fresh blood is what helps this film succeed and it's the father and daughter connection that holds most of the laughs. The film just lacks the menacing style of the original. This feels a little safer compared to the original and while they don't paint the Trump supporters in a positive light, it's not a film that attempts to push your opinions. It's an easy film to watch and the time flies in the company of Cohen. I had wished for better setups but the film is a nice companion to the original without trashing its legacy. 23/10/2020

                        Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is the sequel to the 2006 comedy hit. This was the unexpected sequel no one saw coming. The first Borat movie is a classic. It's funny, daring, offense, and crazy. Sequels for hit movies, especially for comedies never go well. Sometimes you will get a movie sequel that is still a hit, but it never is as good or better than the film before it. When watching the sequel, I was expecting a funny, crazy, and overall a good sequel. After I watched it, I was pretty disappointed. This movie is nowhere near as good as the first. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm has the potential to be if not great, good, however there is a lot that drags this movie down. The comedy doesn't work this time around, there are some moments where you may chuckle or cringe, but it's nothing like the first Borat where you really laugh at some seriously funny moments. The father-daughter relationship subplot didn't work either. It had the potential, but the filmmakers wasted that potential. Another problem with this movie, is that it's surprisingly boring. I never thought I would call a Borat movie boring, but this film proved that the character can get old fast if not written properly. I wish this was a good sequel because there was a lot that this movie could've gone over and poke extreme fun at, but it feels as if there was going the safest route possible, which isn't like Borat at all.

                        I have to say I loved this film and found the portrayal of the father daughter relationship to be extraordinarily moving which I really was not expecting from what is, after all, a format that we all know so well now. 
Sacha Baron Cohen's hapless creation Borat scored a massive hit in his first outing and this feels like a step change although the methodology remains the same. I think we are less shocked by the attitude of the members of the public with whom he interacts as in the times of Trump, we kind of expect the outrageous. What he often reveals here are more human and empathetic interactions even though they may be under extreme circumstances and with people that we perhaps would not find much common ground.
However, the pivotal scene where Rudy Giuliani believes he is being interviewed by Borat's daughter, Tutar (the brilliant Maria Bakalova) makes for deeply uncomfortable viewing and is so shocking that under normal circumstances, with politicians of any honour, it would end their career. It felt creepy and sleazy and I'll leave it for you to judge whether or not you buy the claims that he was lying on that bed ""Adjusting his shirt"" or not.

                        Borat is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. Obviously living up to that film is no easy task but this one could've been done so much better in my opinion. There were a few good chuckles but comparatively, it's not even in the same league as the original. 

The first movie made me laugh so hard my ribs would hurt and so consistently, I'd find myself gasping for air. 

This movie was more cringe than anything else. The scenes were so hard to watch I had to kept pausing the movie to take breaks from how cringey the skits were. 

Yeah the first Borat had lots of cringey scenes too, but they were well balanced with good humor. This movie just left me feeling incredibly uncomfortable, minus most the laughs.

                        ""Borat: subsequent moviefilm"" is amazing! It is 1.5 hours of non stop laughter, as it perfectly portrays every single event happening in the world in a satirical manner, as well as it gets the dark humor good enough. The pranks pulled off are stunning and funny, as you always think about ""How did they do that?"" or ""Did I really just see what I saw?"". I would say that ""Borat 2"" is a great sequel to the first one, with the humor being even better at some points, as well as the ending being pretty fun and neat! It is very offensive, but everyone still likes it. I have a lot of friends from Kazakhstan which find this movie adorable, although not a single mention of Kazakhstan in the movie can be compared to real life, the movie definitely increased the country's popularity! I have bought Amazon Prime for that movie and I'm not disappointed, this is just pure comedy, just like how it should be and it laughs at the face of every belief, every political side and every movement. I would have rated it 5 stars if not a lot of mistakes made during the montage, but trust me, this comedy is worth your time, especially if you are into dark humor like me.

                        Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is Sasha Baron Cohen's follow-up to 2006's Borat: Cultural Learnings…  This time around, Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) travels America with his 15-year old daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova, who is excellent), who is to be offered to Mike Pence as a bribe to help restore Kazakhstan's international image.  Again employing the satirical mockumentary approach, Cohen continues to skewer conservative, right-wing America.  This time around, there is slightly more plot and slightly less guerilla ambush tactics and, while not as funny as the first film, there are still plenty of laughs.  Hi-lites include the father and daughter dance with the debutantes and the already infamous hotel room interview by Tutal with Rudy Guliani.

                        A hell of a lot better than I was expecting it to be going in. Cohen's last great character was Borat and he really shows here that, while he has not hit a home run a lot with his recent works, he can still go back to an old classic and make it fresh and keep everyone laughing. In fact I was laughing out loud throughout a lot of this! While the jokes maybe didn't land quite as well as the first one, this is still a damn funny movie that shed some light on just how messed up the US still is. Waiting for a return to Ali G now!

The best parts of the film are the references to the original. The rest is mostly outrage comedy. Jokes about incest, private parts, etc (Not my favorite). More so the kind of humor you saw in Bruno.

                        Coming (back) to America.  So Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) has returned.  After the events of the 2006 movie, Kazakhstan has long been facing disgrace.  They are offering Borat a chance to redeem himself by traveling back to America once again.  Now I did enjoy the first Borat; I haven't seen it in quite some time, but it's undeniably funny.  While I do have a positive memory about it, I can't say that it affected me in the same capacity as others; many people call it one of the funniest movies ever made, and I'm unable to go quite that far.  I was baffled when I heard the announcement of the sequel.  That film is so iconic; how is he going to be able to dupe unsuspecting people once again?  It would be an impossible feat, right?  Now, even before this hit streaming on Prime, this was already making headlines.  Specifically, Rudy Giuliani tried to stay ahead of this by breaking his negative story in advance.  I don't consider this to be a spoiler since this is already all over the news, but let's say that he gets himself into a compromising position here, and he does not walk away from this looking great.  If nothing else, this movie succeeds because of that scene.  The biggest problem I faced is Borat's infamy; everybody knows the actor at this point, so I couldn't help but question what got staged and what was authentic.  The first movie succeeded in spades because people believed that this was a foreign journalist, and the reactions were both genuine and troublesome.  I approached almost all scenes in this with a skeptical eye, with the one exception of the Giuliani scene.  You can't fake the dynamic of what you are witnessing, and it could very well end up being a career-ending bungle.  Like a train wreck, you can't help but cringe and keep watching, and a lot of credit has to go to Maria Bakalova for selling the scene so well.  She is a chameleon with how much she changes within the movie, and she is an actress to keep an eye on going forward.  As far as the rest of the movie goes, I think that it has its moments.  As you can probably expect, there is a lot of Trump humor in this, and I feel that is where this movie has more misses than hits.  It's just a preference for me; I reached a point years ago where I stopped finding these jokes funny.  Because it is our democracy at stake, I rarely consider it to be a laughing matter.  I will, however, acknowledge that it is hilarious that nobody thought of McDonald Trump before this.  Because they saved the best for last, I can give this a low recommendation.

                        I could tell from the pro censorship speech Sacha Baron Cohen gave just before this came out, that this was gonna be way too neo-liberal for my taste.  And so it was.  But I wanted to see the Giuliani thing for myself (no pun intended) and to see how this would fare in the actual-laughs department.  The fertility dance thing was just about the only LOL that actually transpired.  Not my jam all in all (again, no pun intended).

                        Secretly filmed over the past year, Sacha Baron Cohen reprises his outlandish Borat character to once again lampoon people's not-so-hidden prejudices, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and misogyny, which seem to have only gotten worse since the first Borat movie in 2006. The flimsy story follows international journalist Borat returning to America to help improve the standing of his home nation, Kazakhstan by offering his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) to the Trump administration. It's really just a platform for Cohen to adopt a series of disguises (his Borat is too recognizable) and dupe some rubes while exploiting their ignorance and patience. Much of the entertainment comes from the cringe-inducing interactions of how far Cohen and Bakalova will go, marveling at their improvisational skills and also dreading what lines they might cross next. I was laughing fairly consistently, though the schitck naturally won't be as funny the second time around, even with a 14-year gap in movies. I was really impressed by Bakalova and her own commitment and quick-thinking, keeping pace with a pro like Cohen and really stealing the show because Borat can't go out in public as before. There are some outrageous moments that work, like Cohen imitating a country singer leading an anti-masking crowd into a singalong about ridiculous charges, and some that simply don't, an ongoing stretch where Bakalova explains the appeal of masturbation to a gaggle of deadly silent Republican ladies. Sometimes the comedy seems so broadly caricatured that it's questionable whether its helpful or harmful, especially the anti-Semitic tropes that Cohen embraces as means of satire. Saying something outrageous to an outraged or shocked party isn't quite enough. When compiling these hidden camera comedies, they thrive on the oxygen given to them by the subjects of the prank. If they don't really engage, it can feel a bit tired and desperate. I'd say the ratio of hits-to-misses is about half and half but the movie has enough big moments to keep fans happy. the most notorious moment has already been widely disseminated through social media and serves as the climax of the movie, strangely both as the high-point of pranks and big names but also as the emotional catharsis of the movie. Tutar poses as a foreign journalist and interviews Rudy Giuliani, who drinks, goes into a hotel bedroom alone with Bakalova, and then lays on the bed while slipping his hand down his pants (like a gentleman does). Borat realizes he doesn't want to offer his daughter to this creepy, sleazy man and rescues her because he truly does care about his daughter. Borat 2, or Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm, takes a scattershot approach to satire and squarely aims at the science-denying MAGA crowd celebrating the excess of their leader (who doesn't sound that different from Borat, come to think of it). It might be more admirable in intent than execution but the new Borat can provide a few belly laughs and a few groans as Cohen attempts to make American funny again.

                        No where near as funny as the first film. It was very scripted and mainly just makes fun of conservatives. Most of the jokes were really bad and the situations and recations seemed staged. Overall pretty lame and a big waste of time.

                        Making a BORAT film under all the rare circumstances 2020 brought us makes for something so different, but also, we still get what we want from this type of film. While I feel many moments were heavily edited to make the situation seem more shocking than what actually happened, Baron Cohen just trying to get this thing done in the midst of the pandemic and the Trumpiness and the whole shitshow America has become in the last year is extremely impressive. Some of the gags get a bit tiring and some hit hard. At the end of the day though, this is going to be one of the few films that will really give future generations a good idea of what America was like during this insane year, and it should be treated as much more than just a dick joke film for that reason.

                        Great film overall! Although Cohen occasionally crosses the line from provocative and cringe, the result is brilliant nonetheless. The audacity of this man never changes and he never runs out of ideas. The script feels fresh, although a lot of the movie was clearly staged unlike the original. I suppose the script saved it. My only complaint is that this is quite different from the previous social experiment, this film felt like more of a motion picture than meaningful peice. You cant take anything away from it though, because its crudely hilarious and hysterically performed.

                        Finally we have a movie to make your insides hurt, shed a tear, and cringe uncontrollably. Sascha Baron Cohen chose a great time to drop such a controversial yet entertaining movie, that will test how sensitive you are. Political correctness is not welcomed when you experience this film. I highly recommend easily triggered individuals to stay away. If you are laid back like I am, then this is a brilliant and ridiculous movie, so buckle up for a turbulent ride.

I have no clue how Cohen pulled this off so flawlessly, but I congratulate him for a job well done. It is time for the world to not be so easily offended by what is on their screen and just enjoy the movie for what it is. To my surprise, I thought this sequel was tamer than it's predecessor, or maybe I am just used to his over the top antics 14 years later. Irina Novak, who plays Borat's daughter, easily steals the spotlight and should have spin-off documentary film of her own. The plot is solid and put together well. You can tell that tedious planning and scheduling had to be executed to make sure that this crazy story was pulled off flawlessly. Expect to be shocked from the beginning to the very end as the story comes full circle.

I give Borat Subsequent Moviefilm an 8/10. It doesn't go as deep as people think but there are plenty of unfortunate events, WTF moments and one big bombshell that will may or may not surprise you.

                        A great sequel to an already excellent movie. Borat 2 is a great follow up to one of my favorite comedies of all time. Obviously, Sachs Baron Cohen is hilarious as Borat but I was surprised at how great of a job newcomer Maria Bakalova did as Borat's daughter. She is essentially the heart and soul of the film and did an excellent job playing off of Borat. The film's writing is once again excellent at showing off Cohen's comedic talents and showing the state of the United States in 2020. The film's story is excellent and I was incredibly impressed at how they incorporated the Covid-19 pandemic into the film. Quarantine started during the making of this film and they quickly rewrote the script and incredibly and expertly wove the pandemic into the story. It was seamless and felt like something they had planned from day 1. Something great that Borat 2 does is show the current state of the United States. They are a lot of jabs at the Trump administration which could/will turn some people off from the film but it's hilarious and thought provoking none the less. There is a moment towards the end of the film with a certain politician that's horrible. Not that the film is horrible but what he does is horrible. Since this is a sequel to Borat, it has to be funny and it was definitely funny. I found myself laughing at a lot of moments in the film although I prefer the first film's jokes over this one. I really didn't have a lot of issues other than the occasional slow bit here and there. Go check this out when you can but if you consider yourself right leaning, you might not get as much enjoyment out of it as others would.

                        ""Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm (etc.)"" really doesn't offer much. Of course there are the trappings that we have all already heard about - they do offer moments of disbelief and ""can you believe it?!"" - but is this a good film? No.

I didn't feel enticed to watch it through to the end. Oh don't get me wrong, I sat through it, in part thanks to an obligation to contribute to the inevitable discussion it would generate amongst my friends but, frankly, it bored me. There was also, of course, the scene that garnered so much pre-release attention. Quite cleverly, this scene was at the very end of the movie. Should I have just fast-forwarded? Maybe. Though I will admit that there were other snippets that offered some light relief.

There is no flow to this 'movie'. It is a sum of individual parts and, realistically, there aren't enough of those parts. Maybe this would have been better served as a tv show, removing the monotonous interludes. More effort seemed to go into the credits than into the storyline.

That's not to say there isn't anything to admire about this production. For starters, the acting is quite brilliant. Baron Cohen continues to astound. Every foray of his leaves me running out of superlatives.  Bakalova too is outstanding in her role as Borat's forsaken daughter. I do wonder how I might react were I ever faced with two similar characters...would the camera be nice?

And while there will be rightly much focus on the moments that expose a population's frailties - in some instances, to a scary extreme - there are many moments that highlight underlying human decency, belief system aside. And in these, the movie can be touching.

I like Baron Cohen. I like Borat. I just didn't like this very much as a movie.

                        The third act alone can compete for the most jaw-dropping scenes in a film. This movie shows you the best and worst in America without pulling any punches. I saw a political leader get exposed. I saw a Holocaust survivor tell Borat to ""make love instead of war."" Borat Subsequent Moviefilm might not be the movie for everyone, but if you can handle its harsh truths, it's a movie you won't forget.

You will either be rolling on the floor in laughter throughout or cringing until well after the credits roll. Not an easy moviefilm to recommend to just anyone, but if you enjoyed the first Borat, you will find plenty of laughs here.

                        A worthy follow up to the original movie that shocked viewers and those involved. The concern was that with a sequel, Sacha Baron Cohen was going to be extremely visible as his globally recognized Borat character...that said, he cleverly gets around the issue and it works. Funny, cringeworthy, exploitative, purposefully politically incorrect to reveal the good (or bad) of those involved. All Borat fans should like this outing and those who are sensitive to political incorrectness when it serves a purpose, should steer clear of this one. Relax, laugh, and cringe with one of the best to do it! Sadly, -half star since there is no corky bucek. I need more corky bucek!

In spite all the cringy stuff, the movie was spot on about all the craziness we're dealing right now:  racism, Qanon, Trump's p***y--grabbing, Covid, shootings in jewish temples... oh and, at the end of the movie, did you see the ""Karen"" carrying an ""AR15 rifle at walmart""?? --a shooting happened at my neighborhood Wal-mart last year --so this hits right at home! So if you have an ounce of decency or if this movie made you feel uncomfortable in any way, try to consider, this is who we are! This is America and we need to change.

But it mostly focuses on his daughter who just doesnt have the comedic ability he has. Also, it was more of a political opinion piece rather than focusing on comedy. very disappointed that it couldn't even amount of a fraction of his previous movies.

The first movie was hilarious, this is just a sad re-hashing of the same schtick, although this time Cohen's effort is overtly political, ostensibly to cash in on the divisive current political climate. It's like watching an hour and a half Saturday night live skit , but not a good skit, more like a sad, angry Alec Baldwin skit

The Giuliani scene is hyper cringeworthy and difficult to watch and the optics aren't great for him.

                        So I liked the first Borat, but didn't really think it was as great as people said it was. It was just a very funny, offensive and dumb mockumentary, with barely anything complex to it, if you will. But this really surprised me because yeah, it starts like I would expect it to, but then slowly manages to be emotional which is absolutely priceless. And make no mistake, the movie is still a Borat movie, so it's vulgar and offensive right away. The thing about these two movies is that you see those things that you would see in dark comedies with actors, but here, you know there's a possibility of it being actually real and yes, there are very real scenes here, and one of them in particular really stood out for me, and no, it's not that Rudy Giuliani scene. It's when Borat meets the holocaust survivor. That scene was 100% real and apparently, Sacha Baron Cohen had to break character after they stopped rolling. I would have never even thought that one day I'm gonna be saying that the best scene in a Borat movie is a wholesome and emotional scene. Do I think this tops the original? I think so, yes. The movie is also extremely funny, and as always, and Cohen is amazing in the lead. He had to stay in character for 5 days while he was staying inside a person's house. That is insane to me, and considering that this year was pretty weak, I wouldn't be surprised to see Sacha nominated for an Oscar for this. This also has a strong message for gender equality, and again, that's the last thing I thought I'd see here, but it's also done right, well, as right as it can be done in a Borat movie. So, in the end, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a really funny, and surprisingly hearwarming movie, and the ending is pretty damn unexpected.

                        I'm generally not a comedy guy. I did see the first Borat and found it to be a hodge-podge of prank sketches with some very funny gags. 

Sacha Baron Cohan's follow-up improves over the original with a more story-based approach that still upends the '-isms"" in America (racism, sexism, etc.) in the midst of a freaking pandemic. It couldn't be more well-timed in this brutal election season.

The standout is Borat's 15 year old daughter played by Maria Bakalova (she's actually 24) who steals the show with her cluelessness and likeability. 

How well you enjoy this movie will depend on your own level of political ideology and tolerance to very crude and crass behavior. Personally, I found it hilarious. But it is definitely not for everybody.

Plenty of things you wish would be taken for what they really are - a very unfortunate medium to see the truth about some things... Just keep in mind, it's not all satire. And as offensive as many may see it, it's really hard not to appreciate the fact that you can still appreciate it, even if it violates like every social convention for what's considered PC these days. I recommend seeing it, but more so I recommend the first one for those who have not seen it. See them in order. It's worth it.

                        Spoilers!

The main aspect I enjoy is that this movie does humiliate the worst kind of people; those with racist, prejudice, sexist, misogynistic attitudes, crypto-facist zombie Ghouliani etc. but the cardinal sin is it just isn't all that funny and doesn't compensate for all the cringe it creates. How do you properly lampoon the shameless, living-out-loud audacity of  those who relish their abhorrent views? You really can't. You just film the ensuing train-wreck. That's less genius and more observation of the current prevalent American psyche.

Personally, I think it's demented that a young woman was groped by a living-corpse of a politician and it's played for laughs. It only takes a second for someone to violate another in a way that causes long-term impact and even though Borat (SBC), intervenes it still was risky and in poor taste. 

In the age of the #MeToo movement, when women (and men) are very much still struggling with sexual assault being taken seriously as an inexcusable crime while being understandably scared (and sometimes unable to speak out), many are working hard to have it acknowledged by the law, hoping it holds predators accountable. A myriad of people are actively struggling to survive in the aftermath of victimization; all the while, this movie is not a good look for anyone involved (with two exceptions I will get to in a bit). It's flat-out belittling, perverted and feels regressive. I can't help but wonder how SBC would feel if his wife, who is an actress or his daughter when she is grown, was to be put in such an uncomfortable and potentially  dangerous situation for an acting gig. It's not something I would wish on anyone and in my mind, this gag makes SBC just as sexist as those he mocks (albeit not quite as creepy but not too far off). Way to lose moral high-ground by creating the very heinous problems you purport to abhor by making a ripe environment for them to fester for cheap laughs. 

Now, I realize the actress was of age during filming, apparently fully-consented and claims she felt safe in the process but as a relatively unknown young woman new to fame, this was an uncalled for and risky position to be expected to be in and sets a less-than-empowering standard in an industry already riddled with sexual abuse. It was unfair to her and makes things more unfair to others in the business when this is normalized and applauded as ""brave.""

Plus, unfortunately it won't have any real ramifications for that hobgoblin of a politician (I refuse to even give power to his actual name hence the nickname Ghouliani). I am glad he's embarrassed but it could have been done in a way that doesn't physically subjugate a woman's body. Hollywood exploits women and girls enough and no one should have to deal with such vile and predatory behavior.

 I can't say I'm shocked by Ghouliani's lecherous conduct and idiocy, nor will anyone who has been paying attention think anything groundbreaking is truly revealed when a horrible politician is busted for being as sleazy as the clichéd stereotype. When you look under rocks in a quagmire, of course you will see writhing, grotesque bugs and there are plenty of vile people reveling in their own putrescence and ignorance abounding in this flick. 

Laugh it up America, the joke is on us all too. The sucker-punchline is finding this demented comedy a rollicking good time while our country is being run into the ground by the exploitative administration currently in power. This is more of an existential horror and true tragedy rather than a pithy satire. Many of us were already vastly and painfully aware of the precarious state our fragile nation has been in for some time already. We have to live with the violence, hate and discrimination on the daily. 

Such a grim spectacle being seen as hilarious entertainment is very fitting for 2020 and the past 4 years of BS we've had to endure. I guess it's a sign of these absurdist, apocalyptic times right before the chills of Halloween... ""Idiocracy"" does it better and even ""Jackass"" is more entertaining though.

The best  two highlights and my favorite parts by far are Jeanise Jones and Judith Dim Evans. Their genuine, patient  humanity, compassion and authentic understanding are way more of an antidote to the ills of the USA (which SBC so enjoys showcasing), than his comedy could ever hope to be. One star for each of them. Rather than mocking others that represent the worst of society to feel superior, we should all aspire to Ms. Jones' and Ms. Evans' exemplary behavior. SBC -that goes for you too.

                        Not gonna lie...I laughed. A LOT. 
If for no other reason in 2020, a movie that can make you laugh a lot is worthy of being called a masterpiece. 
And even though this doesn't carry the same revelatory ""America is terrifying"" weight as Cohen's previous works, it is surprisingly sweet and Maria Bakalova is absolutely perfect as Borat's daughter.

                        Loved the original and wasn't expecting much from the sequel but it turned out to be the perfect movie for 2020 providing a great snapshot of the problems with this country. Film takes punches at everyone who is asking for it right now, from the idiots in charge to the nutcases who support them. It also shows how their attitude towards the handling of Covid 19 in the early stages of the pandemic has gotten us to where we are. Despite his character being too recognizable to get away with much of what he used to, he is still able to keep his cover through the use of disguises and a strong supporting role from Borat's daughter Tutar. Borat still has a way of capturing the true nature of people and getting people to reveal their racist, hateful or perverted inner thoughts on camera.

                        Being a huge fan of Borat from 2006 and thinking it was a very clever film, given how uncomfortable certain scenes may have been to watch, I was eagerly awaiting the sequel that was secretly filmed earlier this year. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (and the rest of the title that I'm not filling in for this review) may not be anywhere as funny or as original as its predecessor, but for the time being, there are a few very memorable moments. The first film was a satire on society but done so in a way that is sort of timeless. This sequel plays off of too many things happening in 2020 to really feel like it could be a long-lasting film. This film is all over the news and I'm sure it'll be popular for the next few weeks, but I simply can't see it being talked about ten years from now. 

Borat is a character played magnificently well by Sacha Baron Cohen and follows him on his journey through the United States, exposing the most disgusting aspects of it. This sequel is no different from that, except the plot of the film itself gets a little lost in translation at times. The film begins with Borat being given a mission to deliver a monkey to Vice President Michael Pence but then evolves into him having to connect with his daughter and possibly deliver her to him instead. Along the way, this film has some fun with the two of them wandering around, but I found this sequel to be far too heavy in terms of politics. All this film wanted to do was expose how corrupt the political scene is in the United States and I felt like it was too much at times. 

With all of that said, there are a couple of moments in particular where I found myself wondering how he didn't end up in jail for doing/filming such things, so props to him for pulling it all off. Sadly, I think even certain scenes took things too far and I wasn't exactly laughing, but feeling more uncomfortable, which is probably what their goal was. From incest jokes to luring older men into hotel rooms, this film just goes for it and doesn't hold back. Again, I give it all the props in the world for that, but I won't remember it for being as clever and unique as the first. This film deserves praise for pulling off a sequel in today's climate, but honestly not much more in my opinion.

Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely fantastic at playing this character and that's what makes these films so enjoyable; However, after seeing him in films like Hugo and more recently in The Trial of the Chicago 7, sure, his knack will always be in comedy, but I think he needs to broaden his horizons a little more. Even in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, he shows off his dramatic talents as well, which makes me wish I could see him more dramatic films. Maria Bakalova plays his daughter Tutar in the film and I thought she actually did a great job portraying a character related to Borat, but I thought her character, although the heart of the movie itself, worn thin by the end. Their bond together worked for me, but it felt like a weird balance between sentimental and humourous and that just clashed for me. 

Overall, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is far more controversial than the first in terms of the content, but also less funny and less shocking, so I'm not exactly sure I can give it a recommendation, especially if you didn't see the first film and at least enjoy watching it. These are films that are made for a specific audience and if you know it's not for you, I'd take that advice from yourself. I love the first Borat film and that's why I found this one mildly amusing, but I truly can't get myself to give it any high praise. I chuckled throughout the majority of it, but I felt like I was also forcing myself to a few times. It's not necessary to watch, but if you're already a fan then it's worth a watch. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is now streaming on Prime Video.

                        More UPS faxing and fertility ritual dancing and less political satire please.  The political satire is late to the game at this point.  Some great laughs during the first half but the politics focused second half none.  I don't think there's a political agenda.  Making fun of right winged conspiracy theorists and party figures is more bandwagon tactics.  If Cohen has such an agenda, how does it entail Jewish people, exotic animal transportation, sugar babies, etc.?  His agenda is comedy and this time around it was a moderate success.

                        The first Borat movie was funny and entertaining.  This one struggles to find any humor.  Daughter character was very crude and really demeaning to females.

                        I was curious to see how I would enjoy a Borat movie in my 30s vs the previous one. This definitely wasn't as funny, but it still had plenty of laughs. There were several scenes that were very cringy and hard to watch. I think ultimately the movie doesn't shock as much as the first one because of the world we're living in. We unfortunately know all too well about the racism and hatred that's out there. So the scenes with the far-right wingers didn't come across as disturbing as Cohen probably intended. I also had a lot of questions about how he was able to get so close to Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani. Overall, it's still an effective film, if not as good as the first one.

                        An uncomfortable, awkward ride that showcases some of the worst traits of Americans in 2020. There aren’t quite as many pranks than his first movie, but that’s due in large part to the fact that Borat is now so recognizable that Sacha is likely hard-pressed to find people who don’t know who he is. I’d guess that anytime he’s dressed as Borat (and not a Wil duly strange American archetype), the folks are in on it. Luckily, Bulgarian newcomer Maria Bakalova is able to bridge that problem, and for being rather shy in interviews, I was hilariously surprised to see how far she could really take it, and with ease! She’s got a long career ahead of her, and I would guess some possible Oscar nods. It’s not everyday that an actress can convince Rudy Giuliani and the White House that she’s that trustworthy. And we all know... Rudy really thought she was a reporter. Fans of the SBC will enjoy this film. At times, it may not be ‘as funny’ as the first film. That’s because there’s not currently a lot about America that’s funny — it’s scary.

                        A great film - sure it's bland and frequently gross, but the creative writing, and sense of direction and theme (that I felt was missing from the original) makes this film less of a re-tread and more of an upgrade.

Numerous scenes and connections within this film are very, very funny - also typically a satire of America's nasty side of bigotry and intolerance, but delivered with wit and brevity.

                        Really disappointing, sooo boooring. Cohen tries so hard to hit Trump, that he looses any impact. Except one or two scenes it is not funny, feels forced and pointless. 
The bloody ball fertility dance moment is just disgusting, low point if possible. In any case the daughter character did not fit with Borat story, it was overplayed and she should have been in just two or three scenes, not dragged along the whole fiasco. 
I did not get the scene with Holocaust survivors either, it was Cohen the disturbed boy school play moment. Why dragging two sweet ladies into this mess..?
Only the ending part was edited with some oomph to it, the rest is just amateurishly terrible, shocking for nothing.
 ... and I do not get any of the glowing reviews. Did they watch the same movie?

                        A hilarious and ingenious movie, just like the first one. Despite this, this sequel suffers from a couple of issues that worsen the experience, and most importantly, will not make it as memorable and well-aging as the first film.

Since 2006, pranking and ironic humour has become mainstream and as a result, the reactions from the audience are nowhere near as exciting and hilarious as they were last time. It's clear that a lot of the content is more frequently set up or possibly staged than before, and when it's not, it's certain that people are a lot more likely to play along just for fun.

References to politics are fine, but the way the movie goes about it is very problematic. It focuses almost entirely on mainstream issues, and this is arguably the biggest problem with it. If you read the reviews, you'll find an almost 50:50 amount of reviews that go ""This movie is super relevant to our current culture"" vs ""This movie is clearly pushing a political opinion"". If the political content is the only thing people can focus on watching this, that's a huge problem. I've watched the previous movie only a couple months ago, and nothing felt outdated or confusing. Whereas, in 2034, half of the sequel will be incomprehensible to most. Nobody will remember who Mike Pence or Rudy Giuliani were and people will only have a vague memory of Trump and the coronavirus. Heck, I feel even after the U.S. elections next week it will become partially irrelevant.

Most of the traditional Borat humour and commentary is still there thankfully, making the movie, despite its shortcomings mentioned above, a very good experience. At the end of the day, I was laughing and cringing, and that's what the movie is meant to do, which is good. I definitely recommend it to those who've seen and loved the first film, although it's hard to say which parts of this movie will age poorly as time goes on.

Nice work by Bakalova. 3 stars cuz I'm feeling generous. Comparisons are odious in general, but it's not nearly as funny as often as the first move. But, they still make the subhumans they clown look like what they are. And getting Giuliana like that was KERAZY!!!

                        Very disappointed. I generally don't take the time to write reviews on movies but I am making an exception for this one. I loved the original but this one was very questionable. It did have a few moments where I laughed but for the most part it is obvious how much of a hit piece this was on conservatives. People have the audacity to bash ""republican propaganda"" in these reviews but what exactly was this? It essentially tells people to vote after painting republicans as horrible people,  I'm not even a republican and I see that. I'm all for targeting (and laughing at) the flaws of our political parties logic. The whole democrats are evil thing is funny because it isn't true but the same could be said about all republicans being white supremacist. You could actually see on some peoples faces how appalled some people were when Sasha went to CPAC in klan robes. You want to make jokes about election interference but funnily enough that's kind of exactly what this film was intended to do... This was a bit of a let down and IMO only seeks to sow division and laugh at conservatives. I would have much preferred it if we were laughing at everyone. While I am not conservative I know a few and they consistently feels lumped into the category that this very movie portrays them all in. It does nothing to further dialog and frankly, I just see it as bullying. 

As I said I am disappointed and wish this film took more time to go after both sides equally, attempting to bring people together through laughing at their stereotypes and differences. That's what we need right now and that is in no way what this does.

                        The first Borat is one of my favorite comedies and movies of all time. The 2nd installment fell Flat, the beauty of Borat 1 was the unscripted gaffs at the expense of random Americans with little scripting to the overall movie. This film was the opposite, limited improv pranks and a multitude of boring scripted unfunny plot. The film was very political, not that it bothers me, but it was to the point of nauseation. I get it, SBC hates Trump, now can we get to some pranks? The daughter element was unfunny and cringeworthy. The movies called Borat, but hes missing most of the film. Replaced by some awful and rushed writing. I wish the legacy of Borat was untarnished by this messy propoganda piece. Waste of my Saturday night. Smh

                        Cohen's ""gotcha"" shtick has become a bit too ""try hard"".  Everything now seems to rely more on bad-taste ""humor"" and creative editing, rather than the semi-genuine ""locals don't understand foreigners"" awkwardness of the first one.

Without the jokes landing, there's little to recommend this.  Combine the stale and forced humor with odd pacing, bad timing, and disingenuousness of it all and it's simply not worth your time.  At least, it was a big waste of mine.

                        I made an account just to come here and say this movie was TRASH. Not even close to funny. I literally laughed once. So bad. I thought Borat 1 was hilarious. I was a massive Ali G fan, as well. This was nothing more than propaganda. Amazon offered it for free because there's no way anyone would have paid to see this dull attempt at comedy. It is amazing to see how far Borat's star has fallen. This move was depressingly awful. Of course this movie is a critic's darling because they all drink the same kool aid as SBC and company. Don't waste your time.

                        Political and social satirist Sasha Baron Cohen adds another notch to his belt of films exposing the stupidity of some portions of America and its citizens. This time, Cohen the actor and his character, Borat, takes a backseat to his co-star Maria Bakalova. In her first English-speaking feature film, the Bulgarian shows excellent comedic skills and the courage to do scenes most wouldn't touch.

                        Best comedy in a long time, but these days that isn't saying much.  A sequel doesn't usually surpass the original.  Most times, it's not good at all.  I was pleased to find this wasn't fully the case.  It isn't better than the original, but it's still very good.  It's very political at times, but it was constantly funny, so that can be overlooked.  It was definitely full of laughs.  I'd highly recommend this.

After settling in, I couldn't agree more. I honestly found it better than the original as there are more interesting interactions with Borat's daughter (whos Maria Bakalova Deserves at least a nomination for her part) over that assistant he had in the last one. Definitely worth checking out!

                        This was quite a sweet and wholesome movie which felt a lot more like a self-contained ""story"" than the first movie did. Overall I enjoyed it a lot.
Obviously it's a blatantly political movie, and I think it works pretty well in context - having Borat be a clearly satirical depiction of ultra-conservative values, and somehow managing to be both more *and* less extreme than them at the same time.
Definitely a really good sequel to the original movie, and the only thing that makes it better is scrolling through audience reviews here at all the triggered conservatives who can't take the joke.

                        You've got to hand it to Sacha Baron Cohen and his fearless brand of comedy in exposing the prejudices of political leaders and their followers. As he'd already done in the first mockumentary 2006, his character Borat challenges the social issues with America by allowing a certain handful of its citizens to expose themselves. He's at it once again with this sequel and it's couldn't have came at a better time. He addresses the issues of Covid-19 and Trump supporters' conspiracy theories surrounding it. He even personally targets Vice President Mike Pence and former Mayor (now personal attorney to Trump) Rudy Giuliani and the results are quite revealing. I prefer the first Borat film but there's still plenty of hilarious moments throughout this one and it's hard not to applaud the chutzpah of Cohen.

                        It was a huge surprise to learn that Sascha Baron Cohen had revived the Borat character and was filming another movie in secret. The original Borat was the funniest film I've ever seen, both in terms of how hard and how often it made me laugh. As a result, I was somewhat hesitant about this follow-up, since sequels so rarely reach the standards set by their predecessors. Thankfully, despite some shaky moments, Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy entry into the characters canon. Cohen's accent seems strangely exaggerated to begin with, but he soon settles into the character, and most everything he does throughout the film is very much what we've come to expect from him. While the first film had a very clear and straightforward narrative, this one is a but more disjointed, but it does still have a central premise that ties it somewhat loosely together. The movie still scores big laughs, and scores them often. The jokes are so well set-up and the punchlines so unexpected that you're often taken completely off guard. It's still a film about exposing prejudice and challenging naiveite, and it has a great message about not being shackled by the standards or expectations of others. There's also a brilliant twist at the end that I promise you won't see coming and it ends the film on a fittingly silly note. I'm so happy that clear effort and passion was put into it, and it wasn't simply a cobbled together cash-grab as many sequels turn out to be. It's funny, clever, irreverent as all hell and stands aside Bill & Ted Face The Music as the kind of film that 2020 needed. An absolute treat from start to finish.

Americans are so easy to riff off because of their astounding levels of politeness. Enjoyed this a lot.

                        Not as fun as first but still good. The first 2 acts are pretty well done, even if they aren’t as politically balanced joke wise. But the last act, despite having a fun twist, isn’t really that funny and kinda feels a bit annoying. Not to mention there weren’t as many gotcha moments as the first. And half the time it felt like Cohen and Bakalava were baiting people to do stupid things unsuccessfully. Ultimately, this is a semi satisfying film that delivers some good laughs, but isn’t anything to write home about. Might be worth a watch once but that’s about it.

                        I was genuinely shocked at a few scenes, which I didn't expect to happen.  Also, Sacha Baron Cohen is so hot.  #JewishLove

                        Felt very dry and does not compare to the first one. This Borat film was mainly political which has lots of potential to be funny but i think this movie did not attack it as well as it could have. There was a lot of filler space where i think they could have filled it with more comedy work on the streets or with more people and get more genuine reactions to crazy stuff he does.

                        I'm not a fan of the Sacha Baron Cohen characters, but for whatever reason this film resonated at some of the absurdities that are going on in the United States.  I think a large reason for my enjoyment was Maria Bakalova who plays Borat's daughter.  She's  better than Cohen.  I always have questions about releases and how some of the people on the far right are true believers.  This was a much more humanizing movie and I loved that.  There were some very clever scenes.  Final Score: 8.0/10

                        Borat once again unveils the worst parts of America while simultaneously showing some of the best parts. The daughter aspect really brought a lot of emotional depth to the movie while maintaining the level of ridiculousness that makes Borat Borat. Maria Bakalova seriously nails her part and I'd say she steals the show from Cohen in almost every scene the two are together, except that they work so well together. All in all, it delivers the promised Borat, but adds something special that makes it so much better than the original.

                        Great movie! It definitely took a more serious and emotional tone with the introduction of Borat's daughter. When I first saw that there would be a second significant character in the movie, I felt pretty uneasy, but I can confirm that she was a splendid addition to the Borat universe. Without spoiling too many things, I would say that there are less extravagant idiotic moments than the first one, but when they do happen, it's awesome. Highly recommend!

                        Hilarious!! I laughed more the first couple of minutes just watching the intro than I have in a long time by a film! Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius and I think the script and story has so many funny moments in it's own right, without relying on the reactions of the people they film which I really liked. The feminist theme is very topical and the story about the dad and daughter is actually quite sweet in its twisted way. I even said at one point 'it's even funnier than the first one but for different reasons' - I got the feeling Sacha was just overwhelmed by inspiration with all of these crazy things going on and made the film from the place of great ideas rather than the usual pressure to make a sequel. It was a worthy follower!

                        I wasn't thrilled with it. It had one disgusting part that was kind of funny, but ultimately it was Borat. He does or says stupid things to clueless people and sees how they react. There was no real movement or peril to the film. If you like Borat, you'll no doubt like the film. If you don't, you'll waste your time. I was never a big fan of the first film and this sequel didn't change my mind.

                        A confounding screwball documentary and social satire that peels back the stinky layers of America -- is she just a rotten onion? In Borat 2, you get to watch things you only dreamed were possible. You get to sit with people (no matter who you are) that you have never sat with before. And in doing so there are huge laughs, and a continual shock factor which belies the bigger truths -- we allow for Borat to exist. As an entertaining movie, sure, but more importantly his character in our American Society. As seen in all the different habitats Borat and his daughter visit, Americans turn their eye, seek self comfort and ultimately insulate themselves from the great variations of human life. Let's just say Borat's two Republican friends are real people - if they can deal with him half-naked and kissing their cheeks, don't you think they could have space to understand a Democrat? While Borat 2 is fodder for whatever fire you're burning and flag you're flying (or burning) it begs some deeper questions and points to a hope that if we are able to see ourselves, than maybe we'll start to change ourselves and become better humans to our fellow humans. Humor and satire are a salve, one we could all use more of in these tiring times. Bravo Borat and Tudar.

                        I'm gonna start saying that the moments I laugh, I laughed REALLY loud. But they were so far and between that I can actually recall how many times I actually laughed: 5.

Not a very good start for a comedy film...

Other than that, the movie pales in comparison to the first. Too much cringe. I would skip this one, but there isn't much out there to watch due to 2020. Pretty meh.

                        There are very funny parts in this movie and as a whole its very well done. Maybe not as funny as the original movie 14 years ago. It looks to be filmed with a smaller budget. With Sasha Baron Cohen being a lot more famous this time around he had to get creative with how he filmed his his pranks. Similar to the Jackass crew after their first movie, but in a different way. I did appreciated that the trailer showed a lot of unused footage and did not spoil some of the better jokes in the movie.

                        If the original movie had never been made this one would not have even made it the small or big screen.  There is a reason there was no extra charge on Prime for this film.  If you are expecting belly laughs and a good time don't bother watching it.  It's more sad than funny.  Complete turd of a film.

                        The sequel to Borat definitely proved Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most successful comedians who can expose the most misguided (or utterly repugnant) corners of America. Yes, this is a comedy, yes it is extreme and vulgar at times, but there are so many truths in this film. Definitely makes one step back and think about what parts of America are like.

                        I am not a fan of Borat, I resisted the original movie for a long time, I remember seeing it but not liking the material.
 I only saw the sequel because I think Sacha Baron Cohen is an intelligence asset (like that series he was in) and I wanted to see what kind of narrative this movie pushed on people. 
With that being said, I haven't laughed out loud this hard in a long time! The irreverence and the on-screen responses were hilarious! Narrative aside, this movie really made me laugh, the plot was hilarious, the stunts, and the people were hilarious. 
This movie definitely has a purpose other than to entertain and it is effective, as far as film-making, that's what you want to do. Laugh, people, and #lookintoit.

                        Borat Subsequent Moviefilm like first part, was fairly amusing.

The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is same as first, brilliant.

The movie starts slow but with time, movie becomes amazing and the ending was unexpected. It's execution was better than the first one.

There are no proper words to describe Cohen. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind.

Overall, I would recommend everyone to watch and enjoy it.

What started out as a sequel to the legendary Borat film slowly ended up turning into a cringe fest and endless strings of callbacks. It didn't have the same authenticity and hidden camera prank show feel that the original film had. I did laugh, the abortion center bit and them messing with Giuliani were pretty funny. The rest of the film, not so much.

                        Borat 2 was fkn terrible... I'd put it right beside Zoolander 2 for how bad it was. Most of the movie is totally scripted too... Can't really suspend belief conversations are real when you take into account there is also a camera guy sitting there filming everything. Borat 2 mostly relies on shock value which in this case just felt like they were trying too hard. That is usually also a poor way to get a laugh when you lack any comedic talent or humor. Waste of time.

                        I normally love Sacha Baron Cohen's movies, particularly ""Borat"". But, I have to say this one was borderline trash. There just weren't very many lmao moments and a majority of the time I felt uncomfortable with the scenes regarding a girl that is perceived to be under the age of 18. I also think it was entirely too political. I definitely think Cohen has tremendous balls for the stunts he pulled but I feel that the movie is very much partisan and instead of making fun of both sides of a divided country, it was used to highlight stereotypes and negative features of a group that does not represent the actual base of the political party. It was done in very bad taste, in my opinion.

                        The end of the movie tells you to vote and hits hard on people who are conservatives. That should pretty much tell you why this movie was made and where this movie is going. Its nothing like the first, everything seems very scripted and very agenda driven. This movie will make liberals hate conservatives even more than they already do and will turn off conservatives to hollywood films,  adding more fuel to the gaping divide currently in the USA. Its unfortunate but this movie is another victim of modern times.

                        One of the few sequels that meets the quality bar of the original film.

The first Borat was the critique on America from abroad. This Borat fuses the character we know and love with a critique on some of the darkest areas of the country we know and love. Borat 2 shows us the culture war being waged through our political system that is moronic at best.

Absolutely brilliant performances by Cohen and Bakalova. Cohen is a master, once again, in the moment not only acting out Borat's character responses but guiding the viewer into constant 'WTF moments' because the unwitting actor drives the scene even deeper. Bakalova crushes her character by instantly making the audience fall in love with her and giving Borat 2 the fictional emotional depth the first never had.

Nothing will beat the originality, avante garde, and street performance of the original Borat. But Borat 2 gives us everything we loved about Borat, actual fun/engaging fictional scenes, and a movie delivered that is sure to make a cultural impact at the perfect time.

Those upset that it shows some of the less pleasant narratives in our country need to take a step back and re-evaluate their worldviews. If your preconceived life narratives are so unpleasant that a movie makes you uncomfortable... well then maybe you shouldn't have held those beliefs so hook, line, and sinker.

                        A viewing of Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm confirmed my initial suspicions; this was exactly the kind of satire the world needs right now, and Cohen couldn't have picked a more appropriate time to resurrect the character. The film is occassionally disgusting, consistently hilarious, often brilliant, and constantly crude. It's everything one would expect from Borat, and proof that such a misguided character can still be relevant in comedy filmmaking after so many years on the shelf. While Cohen's humor may not be for everyone, it is certain to illicit laughs from fans of the first film, those not in support of current political administration, and a substantial number of people who are sick of 2020.

Sure many americans will be triggered, but thats propably cause they are already to used to this madness. I would give 5 stars if both parties would been equaly ridiculed. Since both deserve it.

                        My goodness this movie sucked. It has some really iconic moments like that Rudy Giuliani scene. That's pure comedy gold but the rest of the movie is a big cliche with a lot of cringe moments. Now I know tons of people are just looking at my score of this and saying "" this guy hates freedom of speech"" and that is not the case internet people. I loved the first borat, Bruno, and da Ali g show back when it was on showtime I think. It's been a long time. But man I was really looking forward to seeing borat in a new movie and what crazy cool stuff he was going to do this time. This time borat has a daughter. At first I was like ok cool he has a daughter but then it just predicted the whole movie in the first 5 minutes. And I just couldn't with the daughter. It's not bad, it's just disappointing. Borat is supposed to be by himself and his producer but nope borat ""needs "" a story and it does work at the end of the movie with Rudy giluani. I have no clue how to spell his last name and he doesn't deserve to have his last name spelled correctly that creep. I feel so bad for the daughter actress to do that with Rudy. It makes for comedy gold but god dang. I love all the parts when borat is going to the republicans convention thing to find pence. That's hilarious but man everything else is gosh dang cringe. His daughter I think is the worst part of this movie and I apologize in advance. Most of her stuff is cringe and I know borat would do that crazy perverted stuff in the first movie but still. All her bits are bad and I don't think you can do these type of movies anymore. Yes they're funny but once it gets popular you can't go in public and do it. I'm glad they mentioned it in the first 15 minutes of the film. That's a smart and logical explanation for him not being in public a lot. But that kind of messes up the whole movie. The best part of the original borat is that he can go anywhere and everywhere nobody knows who he is but in this he can't do anything. People are getting ""smarter"" hopefully but who knows. This doesn't really work in 2020 unless it's an hour and something minutes doing political stuff. That's the borat I want like the first but this is just cringe.

                        Borat returns just in time to save 2020 (although his daughter is the one who ultimately steals the show). It's not as consistently funny as the first film, but it is much more heart felt, satirical and audaciously vulgar at times.

                        It blew my mind, the first one was really something else, it was fantastic, but this is truly amazing. Baron Cohen's ability to blend in and to make people expose themselves for how horrible they are is incredible, not to mention the fantastic performance by Maria Bakalova, this is satire at its peak, definitely a must watch

                        Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is the sequel to the original after 16 plus years staring Sasha Baron Cohen as Borat.  The story starts out in Kazakistan where Borat is thrown in jail after his initial failed trip to America.  This time around the plot surrounds his family as he flies back to America to gift a present to the VP. He is surprised to see his daughter was packaged to Texas and together they expose the true side of American people's behavior and how they think and act towards others.  The plot surrounds the initial stages of the COVID-19 virus hitting the states and I didn't know how they got so close to the VP in Texas and how they exposed Rudy Giuliani.  The story had some funny moments but it wasn't as good as the original.  It was worth watching it to the end even with a cameo by Tom Hanks.  Overall it was okay but this one was a bit too liberal.

                        Hard to believe it's been fourteen years since Borat's first movie, and my how the times have changed since then. For the sequel he teams up with the daughter he never knew he had and the process of having her made up and touring the country sorta reminded me a bit of Johnny Knoxville's Bad Grandpa. Tutar(Borat's daughter) plays well off of Borat's character, you really do feel like she's really his daughter. Is it as crazy and shocking as the original movie? Eh.. probably not honestly. You still get the shock factor in some scenes sure, but since so many people know about Borat due to his first movie he has to change his image a bit throughout the movie. The scene at the end where he walks in on his daughter and ""America's Mayor""(hah) and Drumpf sycophant, Rudy Giuliani is amusing stuff indeed, just wish it went on longer. Now I'm curious if there will be a third Borat movie at some point, in the meantime this was a nice, unexpected surprise.

BUT

How are there still rubes that don't know who he is? Like the print shop guy, or the babysitter. Surely, they must realize something's up with the camera crew around. Borat was a cultural phenomenon in 2006. He's so recognizable, he's been a go-to costume for the last 13 Halloweens (I love that the film comments on this, having him find his own Borat  costume in a Halloween store). If I think about it too hard, it starts to feel staged, which robs the film of some of its magic hilarity. 

Still a blast though!

                        If you want a good laugh this is not for you. I loved the first Borat. This Borat was literally all a political propaganda push. In a time when we all need a laugh and something ELSE to think about, we get more propaganda. Very disappoint.

                        Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a frequently hilarious film that lives up to the original. Sacha Baron Cohen is as hilarious as always. But honestly the standout might be Maria Balkova as Borat’s daughter. She plays her part perfectly. The film has more of a narrative than the first one. This can give off the feeling that certain parts are more scripted. But damn I haven’t laughed this hard in a movie in a while. At one point I was in tears. This is strong biting satire. It is very relevant to today. Surprisingly, the film has a lot more heart than the original. Thankfully the film never sacrifices humor for sentimentality. Overall, I had an amazing time with this. The real question is how well this will hold up. The film is so rooted in 2020 that there’s a strong chance this won’t be as timeless as the original. Hence, I do prefer the original. Still, I can see this being an interesting and hilarious time capsule of 2020. I highly recommend watching this film, and please VOTE!

                        Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, the sequel mockumentary comedy film directed by Jason Woliner, starring, written, and produced by Sacha Baron Cohen. This film is the sequel to 2006's Borat, one of my favorite comedies, and wow I cannot believe it's been that long! And although not as fresh as the original film, this sequel does not disappoint. The returning character of Borat Sagdiyev is just as raunchy and inappropriate, and the pranks/interviews are as uncomfortable and hilarious as ever! The main difference between the two films is this sequel clearly tackles modern American politics over all else, which gives it a bit of an extra edge.

I definitely don't want to give anything away as far as the story. Borat's daughter is introduced – played brilliantly by Maria Bakalova – which adds a nice, heartwarming side to the comedic elements. The climax of the film and especially the ending, are so shocking, a couple things I never expected. But that's what Sacha Baron Cohen does best, with his mockumentaries. If you're a fan of the Borat character, or just a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's comedic style, I highly recommend checking this one out ASAP, available right now on Amazon Prime Video

                        An ode to women everywhere. 96 minutes portraying the reality of life for women in America. So uncomfortable to watch, with few laughs but rather leaving a lasting impression. He pushes and pushes the audience to new levels of discomfort and sadly isn't met with much resistance from the men he encounters. From the perverted father who whispers he'd pay $500 for his daughter, to the surgeons without morals willing to do 21 thousand worth of surgery on a child, and a lack of any interest in the well being of his daughter. 

The pro lifer and his attitude towards a victim of incest ""god makes no mistakes"" and even the way he treats his daughter isn't far fetched and is the sad reality of life for millions of women married off as children,denied a lack of education and treated as nothing but a tool for men's pleasure. This is the reality of life for women in This world. 

Don't expect laughs, it should make you uncomfortable . This is the reality for women in 2020. 

Thank you Sacha for this uncomfortable film.

                        While Sacha Baron Cohen is still hilarious as the title character, Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm falls apart due to a scattershot story, and jokes that rely on politics and being gross, rather than actually being funny.

His new co-star Maria Bakalova is a perfect pairing and adds a lot of freshness to the film. SBC is a god damn genius and this is the movie people need to see right now.

                        I'm going to be honest. I don't want to be tricked by nostalgia here, and although I think Sacha Baron Cohen is an amazingly talented actor in everything he does, the storyline he thought up for this one wasn't his best work. Of course there were funny parts but on the whole I wasn't captivated like I was in the first one and in the dictator, for example. I think we are all aware that Sacha feeds off of controversy and in the world which we live in now it is clear that there is much less of a market for this and so he really had to tone down his character since the first one, which ultimately made it feel like a slightly unnatural version of the Borat that we all know and love. I can appreciate that it is not actually possible in this day and age for Sacha to make the character as offensive and controversial as he was originally so I do sympathise that it is difficult to make it appeal to the same market as the first one did, but I also feel like this was a rather weak attempt at getting around that and finding other ways to make it funny.

                        To be honest, I have been a huge Borat fan for a while, however a sequel is always hit or miss. And my goodness did Sacha Baron Cohen hit this one out of the park. Hilarious from the get go, and it doesn't let up. Not once does it feel like there's nothing happening, it is just non-stop outrageous comedic gold. This is what we needed in 2020.

                        Sasha Baron Cohen dusts off the grey suit for a second run as Borat Sagdiyev, fourteen years after the release of the first Borat film. If you saw the 2006 film you know what to expect, satire and social commentary turned up to 11. Cohen still employs his heavy-handed approach to making very nuanced comments on modern society, all wrapped in cringe-inducing humor.  Seeing people agree with and feel emboldened by his use of stereotypes that create a safe space for bigotry and misogyny show the audience how prevalent hate still is in the world. Cohen again holds a mirror up to society and creates laughs for those already in on the truth.

                        The first Borat was a masterpiece, showing how America looks to the outside world. It was painful to the point of hysterics. Borat 2 did not deliver the same effect. It was extremely convoluted and did not land the same blows that the first one accomplished so well. Overall, this piece is purely a hit piece of conservatives and did not take opportunities to capture both ""sides"". He stayed within the south to try to ""catch"" conservative people, groups, and politicians rather than playing the field equally. At the end it encourages you to vote. It's quite clear that there was a STRONG political stance in this ""film"" and the only apparent reason it was made was to encourage division and extremism within our country. It might as well have recommended you vote directly for Biden. I do not have a political dog in this fight but the bias in this movie was simply unbecoming and frankly not funny. It had nowhere near the effect of the great film that was Borat.

While it may not be as good as the Masterpeice original, It was still incredible and better then 99% of other comedy movies. Very Nice 👍

                        It seemed impossible, but he did it again, and the sequel is basically as good, daring and poignant as the first film. The last 20 minutes are absolutely outstanding, but everything that preceeds them is also either genius balls out comedy or necessary build up to bring up the characters arch of both main characters. Bakalova should be in serious talk for a Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars, while the film itself should also be (the original was nominated for Adapted Screenplay). Give Baron Cohen the Globe (his 2nd) and the Oscar already...

                        This roaringly hilarious (and somewhat disturbing) comedy is exactly what America needs right now. Sacha has done it again. I always spend at least 1/4 of the either Borat movie just wondering how Sacha puts himself through all of that, but he's such a genius that I simply trust the process. The Borat Subsequent Moviefilm can't beat the first Borat in terms of shock comedy, but this movie has a more prominent character arc for both Borat and his daughter. I'm recommending this to everyone I know... oh yeah, and remember to VOTE!

                        Such a terrible movie. I loved the first one and was really looking forward to this, but the story was lame and the execution felt rushed and forced. I felt bad for Sasha, who clearly wasn't able to get the reactions he was looking for.

                        VERY NICE! The Film is the best prank show I've ever seen. It's basically a mixture of actors setting up the context of his pranks on actual people and not actors. You can tell who's acting and who isn't based on the context of why there are cameras. Timely and hilarious.

                        As a huge fan of the original ""Borat"" movie, I was very skeptical about a sequel, especially after all this time. Silly me. This movie was amazing! How Sasha Baron Cohen and the cast and crew were about to pull this off is a miracle. It's as biting as the first movie, with plenty of moments that are both cringeworthy and hilarious at the same time. But something else is going on here. The story of Borat and his daughter creeps up on you and gives you the feels in a big way. If Borat can learn to dismiss sexism and hatred, maybe soon things will change and people who have come to live by these archaic ideals can change, maybe we all can. Bravo to all involved in this one! I know it was just what I needed right now.

                        A complete abandonment of what made Borat enjoyable to watch. The original film had no plot beyond Borat goes to America and thinks Pamela Anderson is hot, however in Sachas newest installment he believes he can somehow develop a meaningful plot and have humorous ""real people"" reactions (of which he's famous for) all at the same time... it falls flat in both departments... a let down.

                        I am glad I saw it. I think the problem for me with this kind of ""hidden camera comedy"" is it really hurts people who are just trying to be polite. I felt this way with the first Borat -- sure, some of the ""victims"" are awful, but the movie often destroys people who were just trying to be polite and calm to someone who seems vulnerable, and doesn't understand the American idiom.
