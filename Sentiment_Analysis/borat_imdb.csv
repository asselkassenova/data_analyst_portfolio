0,2-Nov-20,eagandersongil,7," More mature, less funny
","""Borat 2"" is a film much more mature and aware of what it wants to do than its predecessor, we even have a very well constructed social criticism, with characters who suffer from ailments and have doubts about their development and personality, everything is very well explored behind a curtain of a black, slapstick and absurd mood but that still works very well, it works out that ""Borat 1"" is funnier, but the sequence has its moments."
1,23-Oct-20,cartsghammond,," He's back
","Borat is back, with this subsequent moviefilm.
This will be compared to the original to no end, but with borat being a cultural icon in America, this one was bound to be very different."

4,23-Oct-20,FixedYourEnding,4," I was excite, but now I am dissapoint
","Who doesn't love Borat Sagdiyev; the clueless foreign reporter from Kazakhstan? definitely not me. I love Borat. I also am a BIG fan of Sacha Baron-Cohen, he is a wonderfully nice person and witty, not to say genius, comedian. This is why it is heart-breaking for me to tell you the stone cold truth: this Subsequent moviefilm is one of his worst works, it's even worse than The Dictator that held that title up to this point."

","The Giuliani portion alone, makes this a must-watch. Can this administration get any CREEPIER? Why yes, it can!"
6,23-Oct-20,schroederagustavo,4," Pretty disappointing
","I can't deny I laughed pretty hard about 2 times and chuckled like 3 times, but most of the movie was a flatliner for me. I am a big fan of the first movie and I think where this one falls apart for me is that it focuses too much on current events (that the movie will probably be irrelevant in a few years), focuses way too much on politics and on the plot with Borat's daughter. Many people are praising her performance here. I think she's fine, but I don't think the script is anything special here and it doesn't help the actors. The scenes I enjoyed the most are those with Borat doing his thing by himself, but a lot of it felt to me like attempting to recreate the mood of the original."
7,24-Oct-20,diegosays,10," This movie DESERVES the bad reviews!!
","If you love Borat, you will understand that the bad reviews are the best reviews. Sacha Baron Cohen threw a bomb in our actual society... And I LOVED IT.
Every sensitive issue that exists today, Cohen broke it with nothing more than the truth that is so much being concealed.
Even if the scenes are fake, he talked about subjects that no one really wanted to talk, and that's why this movie is going to get controversial and some people will obviously hate it. But that was its objective and it means Sacha Baron Cohen did an amazing job.
I would write a longer review about this incredible movie, but it's about those who see it that will know this movie is indisputably amazing."

","For those saying Giuliani was just tucking in his shirt, why lay down on a bed to do so instead of STANDING UP? And that, folks, is part of the genius of this film: that is shows you, live on video what's going on, and lets those who want to continue to lie to themselves, to continue to do so, while being laughed at by others. Don't miss it."
10,23-Oct-20,djkaine,8," I mean...
","It's Borat. Crude, offensive, and fun. It will probably get a bunch of 1's from the poli-cry-babies who claim they aren't judging it based on the fact that it goes against their values, but they are.

16,7-Nov-20,Kdosda_Hegen,1," You have to try your hardest to be able to make a garbage like this.
","This movie was pathetic. Tons of dirty kindergarden level jokes. Just disgusting. Borat 1 was very funny, it used dark perverted jokes time to time to boost the feel of awkwardness and it felt very natural. Here it feels so forced and fake as if they tried to make it the cringest and most awkward movie ever. I'll admit laughed a bit twice or trice, but as a whole experience it was a torture to watch, I'm even embarrassed to admit I've made it though the whole film."
17,23-Oct-20,rphanley,5," I'm a huge fan but this wasn't funny.
",I really was excited for this movie but it didn't deliver at all. It felt extremely rushed and the comedy wasn't there. I laughed once during the entire movie. It's obvious they had a deadline and pushed this out to meet it. This was a huge bummer. I wanted Borat not this.
18,14-Nov-20,Q-Man,6," Some very funny moments, but mostly not
","I would have to say that, overall, Subsequent Moviefilm was a bit disappointing. It had some very funny moments, but most of the time it was not all that funny. I had trouble believing that the people being filmed weren't aware of what was happening. Why would these people allow cameras into their businesses? Would two Q-anon followers actually invite a stranger (and presumably a cameraman) to stay with them? What about the Reverend at the pregnancy clinic? Wouldn't he question the cameras? Other people, too, behaved too normally, without questioning anything. I have read that Jeanine Jones, the babysitter, thought she was in a documentary, so her part was not as unbelievable as the others. She came off as a very caring and sweet woman.
The movie was at it's best when skewering the Trump Administration and associates. That was where it got funny, and right on the mark. Giuliani was laughable in several ways. We have all heard of the ""shirt tucking"" scene, but his assertions on Trump's handling of COVID were absurd. Rudy has become a walking punchline, both with this movie and his press conference at the Four Seasons Complete Landscaping ( between the crematorium and the porn store). He just can't get any more ridiculous.
I would say that the Moviefilm is worth seeing for several good jokes, but, honestly, overall, it is jot great."
19,25-Oct-20,dovla-79048,1," First movies was good but this one is boring
","It is clear that it is politically motivated which is a shame, therefore score is equivalent to that... I enjoyed Sascha while ago, where he never took any part and he mocked everyone equally, but this is a clearly movie targeting right wing voters and party with hidden agenda and releasing it one week before elections. Enough said... Sascha obviously lost his touch and/or he joined the leftist ""train"" just to keep his career rolling (like many of other hollywood actors)."
20,23-Oct-20,bucky716,10," Brilliant!!

26,23-Oct-20,dougmacdonaldburr,1," Borat Jumps The Shark
","This is bad. I used to like Sacha Baron Cohen, but, not anymore. All he ever does is dress up like some weird character and pretend to be dumb in the hope of tricking people into saying embarrassing things. What I really hate is that a lot of the people he tricks are just being nice and even trying to help him, but, he tries to frame it in such a way that they look like bad people. It is all just so his clique of liberal cosmopolitan elites can look down on Muslims and Christians. I will admit that Cohen is smart and capable of being funny, but, he is not as smart or funny as he thinks he is. I watched this with my family (who loved the first movie) and they did not laugh once during this film. It is all basically the same formula and really forced. I imagine this will get quite good reviews because he attacks Trump and most critics will love that, but, this is not a good movie. There really isn't anything that was not already covered in the first movie. They did not need to make a sequel, it is really bad and a complete waste of time and money. Borat has officially jumped the shark."
27,25-Dec-20,SafReviews,7," I thought it was decent
","I watched the first Borat movie ages ago and I thought it was ok but not the best comedy movie for me and I think it's the same case for this sequel. The plot was intriguing eventhough It was crazy, but that's what made it intriguing. There were a few funny moments, but not as much as the first movie; it could be because people are more sensitive nowadays. I liked how the movie focused on important events of 2020 like the coronavirus and the US election. Overall this is a decent comedy movie which I would definitely recommend."
28,11-Nov-20,brefane,1," Seemingly Endless Like the Title
","Even free with Prime membership this lackluster and boring film is a waste of time that, like its title, feels overlong and extraneous. It's shoddy and feels likes it has been quickly thrown together from scenes deleted from the original which was much more entertaining and managed to be believably spontaneous, enjoyably outrageous and even peculiarly charming. Even the character of Borat has become annoying and unfunny and the often hilarious, liberating bad taste of the original is replaced here with a depressingly sour tone and is more repulsive than amusing. Cohen has seemingly lost his appeal and comedic talent."
29,23-Oct-20,EddyTheMartian007,7," Did Borat just save 2020?!
","(No Spoilers) Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bride to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2020) is a sequel to the cultural phenomenon that was the first film, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006). I think it's safe to say most of us never expected this movie to happen, let alone be secretly filmed and release just a couple of months after its announcement. I also think it is safe to assume that most of us didn't think a sequel would be as good as the original. It would just be impossible to recapture the shocking satirical mockumentary that was the first one, but it's almost as shocking a sequel would be made today with all the political correctness, cancel culture, etc. that has become so prevalent in today's media. While this movie is definitely not as good as the original and some of its charm is lost since it has been already done before, and replicated, it still remains hilarious yet important."
30,23-Oct-20,juanquaglia,3," Borat lost his way
","I was a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen until this point. I enjoyed Borat, Bruno and Who is America? a lot, and I considered him one of the greatest American comedians. But what he has done here left me deeply disappointed and even angry.
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm has a couple of great moments, but most of the film is scripted, with few real situations. So overall the film is less enjoyable than the previous one. It is understandable, though. Probably Borat's job is a bit more difficult now that he is recognised everywhere, so I imagine it's quite difficult to find unsuspecting victims.
It is also understandable that real scenes are edited in a way to make them look funnier than they really are. The Pence rally we saw in the trailer seemed very funny, but when checking raw filming from people who were actually there we soon realise nothing happened the way it's been shown. Again, I understand it's part of making a movie.
What I can't forgive is dishonest editing. The famous Rudy Giuliani scene that appeared everywhere as a news story and is supposed to be the highlight of the film is probably the most dishonest and misleading piece of cinematic narration I've ever watched. The editing goes crazy there, with several fragments that last 3 seconds. I'd love to see the raw material from that scene, because I have no doubts it has been presented in a very insidious way.
The other source of disappointment is that overall it seemed like an anti-Trump film more than a Borat film. The propaganda seems to take over the comedy. The timing of the release, so close to the election, also contributes to this interpretation."
31,25-Oct-20,csm-78119,3," Tasteless and not very funny
","This is a poor offering. There are a few mildly funny bits but the casual racism and gross bottom of the barrel subject matter had me turning the thing off half way through. Trump and Trumpism are ripe for parody but there are a thousand better ways to do it than this, which feels like it's been written by a 12 year old boy who thinks he is being daring."
32,28-Oct-20,kosmasp,7," To the point
","As far as I remember, this seems more focused than the first Borat movie. Though I have to admit, I have to rewatch the previous entry in the Borat world. Some things almost seem improbable (like what did he tell people, that they would actually not just go along with some of th stuff but also say really despicably things?), others may seem devious to say the least."
33,27-Oct-20,masonsaul,9," Worthy sequel
","Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel that's as good, if not better, than it's predecessor. It's reliably funny, shocking and extremely relevant. Sacha Baron Cohen is once again perfect with Maria Bakalova giving an equally fearless performance. The majority of the jokes are really funny and shocking making up for the few that aren't as good. It's extremely well paced and Jason Woliner's direction is great. The music by Erran Baron Cohen is fantastic."
34,24-Oct-20,grantss,7," Hilariously funny, in spells
",It has been 14 years since journalist Borat Sagdiyev embarrassed the nation of Kazakhstan with his visit to America and resulting documentary. He has spent those 14 years in a gulag but is now being released. The Premier of Kazakhstan has an important task for him: return to America and bribe the US Vice President in order that Kazakhstan regain favour.
35,23-Oct-20,pedopete-37355,3," Average at best
","1st borat movie was brilliant because no one knew about the character at the time, this time it was horribly scripted and politically one sided. No where near as funny as the first one"
36,24-Oct-20,ryan-beauchesne,8," The Needed Evolution of Borat.. but with an Unfortunate (but Understandable) Lacking of Borat as Himself
","This was the needed evolution of Borat in the sense that it was much more story-focused with many scenes purely for plot over laughs, and a moral to the ending. Especially with a strong supporting actress (Totar was actually the star I believe), it was expectantly a slightly different feel and resultantly also less hilarious overall than the original, but still very funny and very enjoyable. I am glad they did it this way, though, for if they just made a shallow, meandering series of gags like the first film, it would have felt repetitive and lacking anything new. So, I think they did the right thing."
37,23-Oct-20,malcolmjohnston,1," What a waste of time
",Why why why?
38,23-Oct-20,Hazu29,3," Can't be compared with the previous ones
","It's just bad, 98% it's all scripted and staged and the daughter's scenes are not funny.
The old Borat would have epic non staged scenes and he would make fun of anyone, doesn't matter their political side, race or gender. In 2020 we would expect Borat to crash rallies, parades and cupcakes student councils. But nothing... Just staged unfunny stuff and same jokes all over again. Very disappointed. Just watch the old movies. This one is super boring."
39,11-Oct-22,littleriver-65252,5," The First Movie Was Better
","I am a huge fan of the comedy genre and the first Borat movie really was funny from beginning to end at least for me. In the 2020 version however, I was disappointed by how slow the plot moved, and the lack of any real comedy. I think it's fair to say that I did get a few great laughs throughout the movie, but unlike the first Borat movie which was pretty much entertaining and cometic continually, there are many parts in this movie where nothing is really going on, or where the comedy is continuously repeated several times which leaves you no longer finding it as comedic as you did the first time. I think it lack as much creativity as the first movie for sure, but overall, I would consider it somewhat entertaining if you've run out of comedy movies to watch."
40,24-Oct-20,rcsembree,1," So dumb

","First of all, this movie is such a pleasure to watch, all audiences with a robust sense of humor will enjoy it, and hordes of easily offended viewers will fume with outrage. But since half the dialogue was in Bulgarian, I thought I might shed some light on just how great and funny Maria Bakalova's performance was in this film. First, let start off with how difficult this was to film. There are many wild and provocative scenes, Rudy Giuliani's ""bed scene"" chief among them, that were an absolute feat to pull off. Everything was wrapped in a funny, surreal story about Premier Nazarbaev using Borat as a spy on American soil, and Borat reconnecting with his feral daughter whom he uses as a honey trap against US politicians."
45,23-Oct-20,Xstal,8," Making America Grate Again...
","... and for all the right reasons. Some genuinely laugh out loud moments leave you under no illusion just how talented Sacha Baron Cohen is as he ridicules some particularly odious and obnoxious characters, cultures, traditions and beliefs. With outstanding support from Maria Bakalova, you might be surprised how immune you've become to fascism in the land of the free but at least you'll do it with tears streaming down the side of your face and, quite possibly, a blub or two as the satire and mockery is gradually absorbed and starts to sink in."

","My husband loved SCB in all his incarnations (Ali G., Borat, Bruno, and that guy from Who is America). He'd quote parts of Bruno (""But first, more dancing with Bruno!"") as he'd dance around me in the kitchen. He'd quote parts of an interview SCB did with Dick Cheney, as I rolled my eyes. Every couple of years or so, he'd put on Bruno or Borat, and laugh, and laugh, while I just shook my head. In short, he reverted from a mature 35 year old man, into a a teen, because of this one comedian. I kind of hated it and really didn't see the appeal of Cohen's comedy which I found crude and sometimes downright offensive (i.e., ""In my country, they would go crazy for these two.

","Borat is back after more than 10 years since his original installment in 2006, and oh boy if it was funny. I think that this sequel was actually slightly better than the original movie, for sure I laughed more and I really appreciated Tutar, the daughter of Borat portrayed by Maria Bakalova. She was amazing and I genuinely think that she had the most funny jokes this time, her character has a progressive and interesting development. There is a special chemistry between the two main characters and I really like how their daughter-father relationship evolves. Both actors speak their native languages, Sacha I presume communicates in Yiddish, while Tutar I am sure speaks Bulgarian. It shouldn't be easy to coordinate during dialogues when you use two completely different languages, so good job."

Always the same deranged jokes about supposedly endangered Jews and gays and mocking republicans but he does not dare to criticize leftists, Antifa terrorists, BLM or their politicians. Very politically colored, biased to the far left. And this with Giuliani is the only thing that raised dust in this miserable piece of trash. But actually it is nothing interesting. It's all about Giuliani really adjusting his pants and microphones (the actress was helping him) and that was nothing indecent or shocking. And that's actually the whole plot of all this rubbish - how to cheat and mock Republicans and Conservatives. Utterly disaster for low IQ children.

However the film tries too hard to smear conservatives and it just ends up looking desperate and unfunny.
Furthermore the sense of deja vu is overwhelming as SBC recycled far too much from the original and it just does not work in 2020. Introducing a significantly new character is often a sign of desperation and the introduction of Borat's daughter Tutar is no exception. She's like Scrappy doo in Scooby doo or the sand snakes in Game of thrones. Tutar is another awful character but I understand why she was necessary as Borat is too well known in 2020 to trick people into an interview. It begs the question was this film necessary? I would say definitely not. For me it has soured the Borat character and taken some shine from the original film.

","I would say the first movie was funnier but that this one does a good job at continuing that style of humour. Borat's daughter really took the craziness level up a notch. She's totally uninhibited and basically insane, like her father. She really went ""there"" - held nothing back and as a result we got some pretty great scenes. The two of them - Borat and daughter - make a really compelling duo. I'd say the movie loses its steam around the last fourth. The pace is slower and my attention span waned. There were many great moments, notably the baby scene, the tech guru scene and the women's meeting. For some reason, and maybe because in general humour is a lot more crude these days, that the first Borat movie was more risque for its time and did a better job at depicting middle America. However, I wouldn't give this a pass as I do think there are several moments that make this a worthwhile watch."

Borat 2 also has many somewhat amusing jokes, and several gags that aren't that funny, but this is to be expected from nearly any comedy these days.

194,19-Dec-20,gortx,," Borat's daughter shines
","Confession up front: I wasn't the biggest fan of the 2006 original, but I do see how it's spiky energy could have appealed to so many. Sacha Baron Cohen returns here as Borat in this belated follow-up as he returns to America to film another Documentary for his homeland of Kazakhstan.
To be fair, there are a few nice potshots that land here, even if many of them are of the cheap variety. Crucially, original Director Larry Charles didn't return and his offbeat spirit is missing. Instead, new Director Jason Woliner takes a more haphazard approach with the mood shifting from satire to buffoonery to even a ill-fated attempt at bathos. Even the scenes that are supposed to be 'real' and not fully staged, never seem less than artificial, including the much ballyhooed Rudy Giuliani one. Giuliani may be a wacko conspiracy nut, but, he's been around cameras for decades and decades. He may not have fully understood how he was being set-up, but, he knew SOMETHING was up. For all it's notoriety, the scene is a flop**.
Who does shine is relative newcomer Maria Bakalova as Borat's daughter. Bakalova tosses herself into the role and never shies away from even the most uncomfortable of situations (see Rudy Giuliani). She's funny, she's charming and about as genuine as a Borat character is allowed to be. Still, whoever thought that what the Borat series needed was a warm and fuzzy subplot made a miscalculation. Did anybody think that what Allen Funt or Ashton Kutcher really needed was a backstory in Candid Camera or Punk'd?
Bakalova and a few choice gags aside, SUBSEQUENT MOVIEFILM simply can't compete with the events of 2020 for shock value. It was already passe upon release."

That out of the way...
Is this belated sequel (one that I personally never thought would get made) any good???
HELL YES!!!! It's not as candid or as raw as the original film, but with Mr Baron Cohen not being able to dupe because he is recognised by so many now this film still has the power to make you fall off your seat laughing, cringe at what is happening and be shocked (in at least two scenes all of these at once)"

","Sasha Baron Cohen is back as Borat, the intrepid journalist, and this time he mostly takes on McDonald Trump and Mike Pence. If you are a MAGA hat wearing viewer, you will be offended, but for all others, you will love Borat. It begins with our star in a gulag for offending his nation in the first film. He is released to bring honor to his nation by delivering a gift to Mike Pence. At first it is a monkey but later turns out to be his teenage daughter. Not as good as the first film, but still very funny."

In theory it's interesting that you catch a politician in an awkward position and instead of just releasing a the clip, you make a whole film around it. But in practice, the whole film is a chore, full of cringe and not funny moments. Sacha is clearly just a leftist who is triggered by Trump, and while this isn't a problem in itself, it's quite clear he can't express this in a very creative way, probably the worse thing he has made to date. It also seems to me that unlike the original Borat, a much higher proportion of people in the film are actors, and this kills a lot of the humor. I find it really quite strange that so many people revere who thrives on mocking humiliating people after lying and manipulating them to be in awkward position, at the very least it seemed like the harm was bounded when it wasn't political."

I'm trying to decide if the film was disgustingly stupid or stupidly disgusting, but either way works for me. Let me ask something, how is it that people like Sacha Baron Cohen never get called out for his exploitation of women and demonstrably misogynistic and juvenile behavior? Wait, wait, I already know the answer to that, it's pretty easy to understand and I'm sure you can figure it out. And I'm not even coming at this from a political angle, because for all the negative reviews on this board calling the picture an exercise in Trump bashing, he also got in some good shots against Obama and the Clintons, so at least he was an equal opportunity idiot here. The scene where Borat does the vagina dance, wait, excuse me, the 'vagine' dance with daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) sets about the lowest standard in humor that I can come up with, but then again, I generally stay away from what I like to describe as fodder for the lowest common denominator.

","Perhaps my sense of humor has evolved since 2006. Or maybe I'm just exhausted by politics and the pandemic. Could be a combination of both. Who really knows? Nevertheless this one much like ""The Dictator"" & ""Brothers Grimsby"" was a flop. The scenes in the original Borat were too many to count when inducing laughs. From getting a congressman to eat cheese made from breastmilk. To getting dialect lessons from black teenagers in Atlanta. To trying to kiss strangers on a new york subway. It was amazing comedy from start to finish. And one of my top five of all time. This go around for me was sadly a sequel which should have just remained an idea. Anti-semitism, sexism, xenophobia, menstral cycles and incest just don't seem nearly as funny 14 years later. Look, if you hate the GOP and despise Trump and his supporters then you'll probably love this movie. As the piling on is incessant and theirs plenty of fuel for anyone who's rage against Donald Trump burns mightily. But if you're indifferent and want a break from the tumultuous atmosphere that is the chaos of the United States in 2020 you'll be sorely disappointed. If anything it amplifies this exhausting year. I am all for laughing at America in spite of itself. The Kazak national anthem at the Texas rodeo in the original is one of my favorite of all of SBC's sketches. But the ridiculing of right wing supporters were hollow this time around. Most importantly, the reactions (which imo made the first film as great as it was) were also extremely mild. It felt as if SBC and Maria Bakalova were overreaching a lot. And when each shock was delivered the unease and explosive tempers never surfaced."

Still I was shocked at just how absolutely awful this film is. I wanted to like it. But I cant give credit where its not due. In my opinion he could of done much better. Could of been such a funny film in a critical time. When the world needs laughter. Not more disappointment! I mean there's so many people that dont get paid. That could of made this opportunity. Way more enjoyable. That's sad considering were discussing veteran writers, comedians, actors and more. But lacks the passion of your average youtube sketch. It didn't seem like his heart or mind was in this project. Maybe it was , who knows..... But personally I wouldn't recommend the 2nd Borat to anyone. The first had a large niche group. This movie was all over the place though. Most of the jokes. Are relying on shock value. Borat is well known now too. So he couldn't as easily interact with the public like before. Why he chose to put on the worst disguise and personality to evade that is beyond me. Wasn't funny , just annoyingly stupid. A 15minute group discussion could of came up with a million better ideas. Then the girl...... Ugh.... Another parlor trick that worked out horribly. Now he has to make a 3rd one to return any of Borat's integrity. Sigh..... I know this guy is smart too. I just dont get it..... Like zero pride in this film. But who knows maybe he was highly restricted. But then why do it at all ? I wouldn't waste my time. But feel free."

He portrayed Melania as a ''lucky one'' for living in a gold cage rather than in a normal one. I think Giuliani was under the impression he is going to get lucky. Kind of reminded me of ''The Limo '' episode in Seinfeld where George was close to getting lucky to a nazi simpathiser. The Facebook touch was also brilliant as more and more people believe stories on their Facebook feed which could really be written by anyone who wants to have a laugh at the expense of gullible people.

I honestly it holds up decently compared to the first one, sure it has a lot more scripted scene and the storyline is more coherent, but the fact that SBC can still get those kind of reactions out of people years after he reached worldwide fame is honestly jawdropping.

328,26-Oct-20,theredsky,7," Borat Subsequent Moviefilm Review
","A great sequel to an already excellent movie. Borat 2 is a great follow up to one of my favorite comedies of all time. Obviously, Sachs Baron Cohen is hilarious as Borat but I was surprised at how great of a job newcomer Maria Bakalova did as Borat's daughter. She is essentially the heart and soul of the film and did an excellent job playing off of Borat. The film's writing is once again excellent at showing off Cohen's comedic talents and showing the state of the United States in 2020. The film's story is excellent and I was incredibly impressed at how they incorporated the Covid-19 pandemic into the film. Quarantine started during the making of this film and they quickly rewrote the script and incredibly and expertly wove the pandemic into the story. It was seamless and felt like something they had planned from day 1. Something great that Borat 2 does is show the current state of the United States. They are a lot of jabs at the Trump administration which could/will turn some people off from the film but it's hilarious and thought provoking none the less. There is a moment towards the end of the film with a certain politician that's horrible. Not that the film is horrible but what he does is horrible. Since this is a sequel to Borat, it has to be funny and it was definitely funny. I found myself laughing at a lot of moments in the film although I prefer the first film's jokes over this one. I really didn't have a lot of issues other than the occasional slow bit here and there. Go check this out when you can but if you consider yourself right leaning, you might not get as much enjoyment out of it as others would."

With a slight taste of a unexpected family feel towards the end. Extremely well put film to make people laugh so hard that people have to rewind 3 times for a good laugh.

","Just like the majority of all sequels this pales in comparison to the first Borat film. The first Borat was near genius and incredibly funny but even Borat points out that he is too recognisable to pull the story off one more time. Hence a lot of the so called 'real people' feel like actors or people who are just going along with the joke. Yes it certainly not the fault of Cohen that his film was so successful he can no longer get away with it, but perhaps it's a shortfall in thinking that it was worth going for a second shot. It just felt a little desperate and also rushed, too focussed on what they thought was a gigantic satirical opportunity, that being 2020, the year from hell. Yes they were right, grab the bull by the horns but the bull had already dashed unfortunately. Nice try Sascha but no gold medal, maybe a bronze if you are lucky."

","The main source of pleasure from watching any segment of Borat (or movie in general) is watching ""normal"" people who find themselves in unfamiliar situations trying to get out of such difficult circumstances. The first Borat was mostly apolitical, interested in exposing American hypocrisy. Well, as it happens, the truth is stranger than fiction, even if the concept of truth simply does not exist in this case. The continuation, of course, is more like a propaganda campaign for Biden, but it must be said that it took Cohen 14 years to get Borat back on the screens. Realizing that this character was a victim of his own success and could no longer fool people, the Kazakh reporter's sequel is exhumed with all possible cynicism: he has evolved in the right direction and is not a blind copy of the original; yet the sequel has added interesting, relevant ideas to the modern world."

In this one, Sacha Baron Cohen seems less concerned with comedy and pulling off meaningfull and successfull pranks and more with making a political statement. You see, the magic of the first film is that the movie approached western society from a completely oblivious, ignorant standpoint, it did not choose right-wing people exclusively as targets.

Sacha is a fantastic actor and that associated with an incredible control not to go out of character and of course an insane dosage of courage, they dictate the quality of comedy of the movies and TV shows that Borat has appeared. The most important aspect of Borat in my opinion is not the outrageous lengths that the character goes for the laughs, but rather the intelligent and defenetely not subtle criticism of all that is wrong in our society.
For those not familiar, Sacha has had several comedic characters throughout his career, they are usually exaggerated caricatures of individuals, and they have the goal of showing that not only these are indeed ridiculous stereotypes but also at the same time exposing the discrimination, racism and hypocrisy of the people that interact with him."

","I think the charm that borat was searching for was to display a hilariously offensive character in the world and political climate of 2020. They managed to create some pretty funny scenarios for Borats character to encounter with clever writing, and great improvisation from the actors. Where the film kind of fell apart for me, was that they were trying to portray many of the scenes as if they were raw reactions and takes with ""real people"". They had scenes in department stores, health clinics, and other every day locations. Although it becomes glaringly apparent that the people Borat talks to are actors, or at least playing a part. It gives the film a feeling of inauthenticity and detracts from what I believe they are trying to do. At times the film also blurs the lines between what is clever and funny, and what is just unsettling and gross. Given the timing of this film and the US elections, it feels uninspired and rushed.

","'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' or for short 'Borat 2' directed by Jason Woliner is the most surprising production I've seen so far in this strange year, a proof that interesting films can appear despite or even due to the pandemic. The film is a sequel to the first 'Borat' made 14 years ago, resuming the American adventures of the pseudo-Kazakh character invented and played by Sacha Baron Cohen in the America of 2020. One of the things that happened during this time was was the series 'Who Is America' in which Cohen practiced and perfected scenarios in which the imaginary stereotypes of the characters meet real people, some stereotypically banal, others at the political or religious extremes of American society. The premises are farcical until the confrontations of characters and ideas make them seem painfully real. Satire is all the sharper as the characters Cohen / Borat encounters become more involved in their own roles, and those are the instances when comic effects are most successful and satire is devastating. However, the surprise effect is missing, not only that the formula is the same as in the original 'Borat', but also some of the comic effects (for example using 'exotic' languages) are repeated, and in almost any category the comparison with the original is unfavorable."

","Borat 2020 is funny in many places, and trenchant in its satire, but frankly not as funny as Borat 2006 which was hilarious. Part of the problem is that Borat is such a recognizable character to many folks that we can't be sure how much of his interaction with others is unscripted. In addition, a few scenes, even for a viewer like me who doesn't like to put limits on humor, tested those limits with borderline bad taste, e.g., COVID-19, which has killed over 400,000 Americans, was initiated by ""gypsy tears""and spread by Borat. Nonetheless, there's brilliant comic moments in this film, and much sarcasm: the QAnon conspiracists are referred to as ""scientists.""

It centers around Borat trying to get his daughter pretty to be able to marry someone. and that's basically the whole story. the reason I think this is a movie more than a documentary is because it focuses around Love and family, and how Borat finds true love for his daughter rather than needing to. there were a few funny things from this movie but there's no way that it could be funnier than the first one. If it were, there would actually be execution's towards them. the first film was way more racist and sexist. while this movie focused on being pretty much just sexist material because race is a harder thing nowadays.

The film is tired, over the top, politically biased and just not that funny. It aims to offend and shock but at the expense of entertainment. There is a Tom Greenish quality to the film where Baron Cohen indulges himself in his own opinions and beliefs where it ends up trying way too hard.

","The original Borat is a hilarious mix of documentary and set-up prank comedy, but I had no idea until I saw the trailer that there was going to be a sequel, I just hoped it would be as funny. Basically, journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Golden Globe winning Sacha Baron Cohen, also writing and producing) has caused his home country of Kazakhstan humiliation with his film, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. He has spent the last fourteen years of a life sentence imprisoned in a forced-labour camp. But the country's Premier, Nursultan Nazarbayev (Dani Popescu), releases him, giving him the mission to deliver Kazakh Minister of Culture Johnny the Monkey to President Donald Trump to redeem the nation. But he cannot get close to Trump, so he instead opts to deliver the monkey to Vice President Mike Pence. Borat is transported in a cargo ship and arrives in Texas, but his celebrity status in America means he has disguise himself to maintain a low profile. He has no monkey to deliver however, when he discovers his teenage daughter Tutar (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Maria Bakalova), born during his time inprisoned, has smuggled herself into the animal's crate and it has been eaten alive. The plan is changed to deliver Tutar as a gift for Pence, or Borat will be executed. Tutar receives a makeover, and she and Borat learn about etiquette. They attend a debutante ball, where Tutan has her period, and her menstrual blood is prominently displayed during a father and daughter dance. Discovering that Pence is close, Borat disguises himself as Trump in an attempt to offer Tutar to him, but he is thrown out be security. Informing Nazarbayev of what has happened, he is ordered to return to Kazakhstan to face execution. But realising they can offer Tutar to someone else close to Trump, she suggests they go to find Rudy Giuliani (Razzie winner for Worst Supporting Actor), Trump's lawyer. Tutar contemplates surgery to have enlarged breasts and is left with professional babysitter Jeanise Jones. But Tutar realises many of Borat's teachings about American culture and views of women and femininity are wrong, seeing women driving cars, and masturbating for the first time. Tutar decides not to get the surgery and lashes out at Borat for keeping her oppressed her whole life. She also wrongly believes that the Holocaust did not happen and leaves her father in anger. Borat is devastated, but confirms that the Holocaust is true after meeting two Jewish survivors who treat him with kindness after he was suicidal. Overjoyed, Borat goes looking for Tutar, but finds the streets deserted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He quarantines with two men who have strong views on American politics. They help him find Tutar; she has become a reporter and will be covering a March for Our Rights rally in Olympia, Washington. At the rally, after Borat performs onstage in disguise, he and his daughter reconcile, and she agrees to meet Giuliani, arranging an interview, but without Borat joining her. Talking to the babysitter, Borat realises he loves his daughter too much, and intervenes during Tutar's interview with Giuliani which has proceeded to a bedroom. Borat decides to face execution in Kazakhstan and Tutar promises to go with him. Returning to his home country, Borat is shocked to find he will not be executed. Nazarbayev reveals he is was injected with with SARS-CoV-2 and went around America to spread the virus as retaliation against the USA for making Kazakhstan a laughingstock, making him patient zero of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Borat has recorded Nazarbayev's admission, he and Tutar blackmail him into giving Borat his job back and changing Kazakhstan's misogynistic laws. Three months later, Tutar and Borat are a reporting team. Also starring Tom Hanks as himself. Cohen returns to form as his outrageous and idiotic alter-ego and dons some terrific and handy disguises, including and Bakalova is an up-and-coming talent as his innocent daughter brought on the journey who is discovering herself. It is fair to say that some of the over-the-top jokes are similar in style and delivery to the first film, but you cannot help but find yourself laughing at most of them. It is perhaps not as well-written and thought-out as the original, and the themes of the Trump presidency and the necessary inclusion of the coronavirus are less interesting, but it is not a bad mocumentary comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and it won the Razzie for Worst Screen Combo for Rudy Giuliani and his pants zipper. Sacha Baron Cohen was number 8 for Ali G on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, Borat was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Funny moments, along with Bruno at number 77 and Ali G at number 6, Borat was number 17 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Ali G at number 6, and Sacha Baron Cohen (as Ali G) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian.

Sacha is his usual amazing self, always staying in character through situations that would quite frankly have me pissing my pants laughing. The real treat here is his daughter. I've never seen Maria Bakalova before, but she more than holds her own on the screen and even outshines in a lot of scenes. Equally as fearless and fun as Sacha and a great sport for putting herself in a potentially bad situation with a prominent American figure. Trump supporters will no doubt cry fake and throw stones, but without verging into spoiler territory I'd say it was pretty obvious what happened and I'll say no more, other than I doubt Sacha would compromise his artistic integrity by lying.

493,25-Oct-20,ironhorse_iv,7," This comedy movie was mostly nice.
","Jagshemash! This mockumentary once again centers around Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev, a naïve misogynistic, racist, anti-Semitic stranger to American culture (Sacha Baron Cohen). While not as controversial shocking nor funny as the original. This Amazon Studios Video on Demand sequel directed by Jason Woliner deserved a high five for having more heart than the 2006 flick. While focusing on Borat's relationship with his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) on her arranged marriage to a top US politician can get annoying at times especially with the actress use of a heavy Bulgarian accent loud over nagging voice. I found the chemistry between them generally moving. Good acting. Both individuals do grow more likeable as the film goes on and into better people. It's so unlike the first movie where the individuals mostly stay the same. Nevertheless, I didn't like what the filmmakers did with original supporting characters like Azamat (Ken Davitian) & Luenell (Luenell Campbell). I get that the performers had pay disputes, but their characters should be written off the film a little better than what we got. Still the sequel does a good job acknowledges its predecessor's success as well as the gap between movies, by explaining in universe that the first film made Kazakhstan into a laughing stock in the national stage. Thus, the government punish Borat for over a decade until he was given another chance with this sequel. Nevertheless, the guerrilla prank style filmmaking kinda has wine down since 2006; as the character's image has become way too popular. Cohen even had to retired Borat at one time due to being unable to fool unaware real people to gain access to their genuine' s reactions toward solecism for laughs. In order to make the movie work, Sacha had to put Borat under heavy makeup and new disguises or give comedic trolling the crowd scenarios to Tutar. Because of that, there is very few scenes of Borat dress in his traditional suit and acting like himself; which is a shame. To add onto that, the people that he does interacted with, seem more in with the joke than the other movie. I'm not saying that they were paid performers, but I doubt that conspiracy theorists Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell would allow a man with a filmmaking crew to stay with them for five whole days without noticing something odd during a pandemic. Bits like them going to find Tutar at a rally seem heavily rehearsed. The same can be said with Jeanise Jones who drives her to the clinic and gives a bizarre, but inspiriting semi long speech to Borat's daughter about womanhood. It's really hard to believe that these people didn't know that it was a work. The only confirm person that I can tell that was in with the joke was Holocaust survivor Judith Dim Evans. Her story was so charming that Cohen broke character. Sadly, the film's creators still got sued for fraud when her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that Judith did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness despite otherwise. Surprisingly unlike the first movie that result in many legal actions by participants ranging from individuals to whole cities. This one had little. Still, as of this writing, it is too early to tell. After all politicians like Rudy Giuliani might sued over allegations of impropriety. The actress did kinda led him on. Regardless the country of Kazakhstan will probably continue to hate their backwater racism portrayal in these films. Some Kazakhstanis really wanted this film to be canceled. I doubt that they would be happy with the twist ending involving the coronavirus. Still it makes me wonder what was the original climax if the pandemic never did hit during the production of this movie. I can see it being much more grandeur. COVID-19 really did good a number on the flick as the banning of large gatherings meant less events for Borat to crash into. While Cohen was indeed lucky to gain access to one of the Republicans key conferences. He didn't get the reaction that he was looking for with Donald Trump like he got with Ali G with the ice cream glove business skit. It's a shame that the scenes with Trump got cut from the final version. As for the sequence with Mike Pence. That interaction wasn't as impressed in real life. Unlike the film with the long pause, Pence just continue his speech as if they weren't any disruption. Cohen was quickly escort out of the building. Unlike the first Borat flick, in which the actor was famously arrested nearly 100 times and follow by the FBI. He felt that he risked his livable more making this movie due to the harsh political unrest that came with the pandemic. Cohen even said there were two separate occasions in which he had to wear a bulletproof vest. It's safe to say that the rightwing rally where Borat sang an offensive song was probably one of them. While that song was somewhat catchy. It was still disturbing to see some people cheer him on. It reminds me so much of the 'Peace' episode of the Da Ali G Show when Borat sang a similar tune. While I do like that Cohen mocked their echo chamber attitude toward the coronavirus outbreak for all it's worth. I just wished they didn't recycle the same types of the pranks that you can see on one of his old show. It made some of the sequences somewhat tiresome. Meanwhile others felt disconnected and uncompleted like the random barbershop gag. Regardless, the humor in this is probably better than what Cohen plan in the unauthorized sequel called 'My Brother' starring Borat's mentally-challenged brother Bilo. The cringe factor in that version would be too much to handle. Overall: Dziekuje Cohen for making the right decision. In the end, while the movie is not as good as the original. It's still worth skipping sexy time to check out. A must watch."

","Subsequent Moviefilm follows the same basic premise as the first movie; Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as an outlandish character and travels across America pranking real American citizens, and revealing the true nature of normal people, from the good to the bad. This time however, instead of chasing after Pamela Anderson, Borat has his daughter with him, and hopes to marry her off to one of Trump's political allies in order to earn a better reputation for glorious nation of Kazakhstan. This results in a much more interesting and engaging story, and gives us another character to get to know and really root for. Azamat, the producer in the first movie, was never given much attention as a character. He was just someone for Borat to feed off of. But Tutar is not treated the same way, and even has her own character arc and her own chances to prank people. Not to mention the twists and turns brought on by current events that were moulded into the story so effortlessly it's hard to believe they started filming this last year before everything hit the fan. Not only is the pandemic slotted in so seamlessly, but it manages to elevate the movie - from a narrative standpoint - far above anything else Baron Cohen has done."

","Incredibly enjoyable, hilarious, and very entertaining- the sequel to 2006's legendary comedy Borat somehow is able to not only hold up in this time and age, but also prove to be almost just as good as its predecessor. Being a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, I enjoyed this film quite a lot. It was what I wanted it to be, not necessarily more, but it was satisfying to watch nevertheless. The film is a brilliant and well executed satire on values, our government today, and of course politics- and between these themes, ideas, and messages, it is also able to provide a surprisingly compelling story. I of course enjoyed Cohen's return as the outrageous titular character, as well as the continuation and expansion on many of the insane concepts from the first film. The biggest surprise of the film, however, is Maria Bakalova performance as Borat's daughter Tutar. She is not only able to keep up with Borat's outrageous situations, but also prove to be quite funny, moving, and fun to watch on screen. It's an insane film, with insane shoes to fill, but somehow this sequel from legendary comedian Sacha Baron Cohen is able to accomplish all of it, while proving to be more consistent and almost as funny as the original.

A couple of strong laughs, but I'm reading reviews saying 9/10 and wondering what these people watched. No Luenell Either? I'm seeing that the bad reviews are woke and saying ""Republicans or rednecks won't like it"" of course people have to get political and not just watch it, and what would republicans be mad about, Giuliani scene was cringey more than funny, and if you didn't want to hang out with the cabin boys after, you clearly are enjoying 2020 being locked in. From my group what I could tell is, if you liked the daughter character you liked it a lot, if you didn't, obviously you won't. I probably should give it a 4, or a 7, but I guess to me it was like watching the sixth sense a second time. That's probably a dumb analogy, but I couldn't get past the novelty had worn off.

It's basically an anti Trump movie right before the elections, but I don't get the point. Will anyone watch it and believe that it's not staged? The first movie was not that was clear but this? What's the point of the part when he goes in the synagogue dressed as a Jew when it is know that the the lady who are there already knew that this was a set up? Wasn't even funny. Who believes that the part when the three of them are in quarantine and come up with a song that he sings a day after is not staged? The whole movie seems fake and I can't remember one part that was actually funny. Too bad he did a second part , I hope he does not ruin Bruno if Trump wins the election...

","'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)' is about as successful as the first flick, though it still suffers from similar issues. What mainly sets it apart from its predecessor is the fact that its characters are actually afforded some growth; not only are their backwards views satirised, they're actively challenged. As usual, the affair is at its best when it calls attention to - via poking fun at - the various political problems within that plague the USA. Shot on the sly, it manages to tell a remarkably cohesive and relevant story even in an ever-evolving political landscape. It's often funny (probably more consistently so than the first), with newcomer Bakalova holding her own against stalwart Cohen. There are also some real jaw-dropping moments, for better or worse, and a segment that actually gives some sickening insight into what happens behind certain locked doors. Plus, a final reveal brings everything together in an absurd yet almost side-splitting way. Of course, the film is basically just a series of skits. Its emotional drive, though surprisingly well-done, doesn't hold as much weight as you'd like it to (though you'll probably give it a bit of slack). Several of its skits are a little hazy as to whether they're punching up or down, too. Still, this is a shockingly good follow-up to a fifteen-year-old film. 6/10"

560,26-Oct-20,andrewroy-04316,7," Just like its predecessor, this is a funny and smart satire of American society
","Borat Subsequent Moviefilm definitely has the same feel as the original, though it is certainly less of a broad exploration of American culture than a very pointed political satire aimed at the current election. It may be less timeless than the first due to its emphasis on Trump and the current political climate, but I also think the clarity works well for its purpose. We get the same style of jokes here - Borat meeting various types of people and seeing many of the flaws and prejudices held by Americans. Much of the film is spent with two Trump supporters and later parts of the film center on Giuliani, and the ending really drives home the message that even people from the backwards nation of Kazakhstan recognize the idiocy of the current administration and many of its racist supporters. I also thought the COVID-based twist in the film was funny and worked very well. The biggest star of the show, though, is actually Borat's daughter, played by Bakalova. She is absolutely fantastic, which I imagine is even harder to do when some of the characters weren't acting. There are a lot more jokes here centered on Kazakh backwardness, particularly regarding women (for example, I didn't find the jokes about the book to be that great), which are the ones I liked least about the first and feel the same here. Most of its scenes focused on satirizing modern America, however, are fantastic. The Trump supporters, the Giuliani and Pence scenes, and the ending all work really well. Also, while it wasn't really a political joke, the scene talking about getting the baby out of her was the funniest bit from either of the movies. Just like the first, it has its hits and its misses, but at the end of the day it's a comedy with lots of funny moments and plenty of interesting ideas and scenes."

562,28-Oct-20,mateusolivotti,8," Borat's return!
","Okay, the first Borat was controversial, sparked some processes, but its 2020 sequence will likely have many, many more processes. Without a doubt Sacha Baron Cohen is a brave person.
14 years after the events of the first film Borat is sent back to the United States, but this time with a different purpose and alongside his daughter.
We waited 14 years for a sequel to the first feature, and was it worth it?
the answer is yes! It was very worth it
Borat 2020 presents the same kind of humor as the first film which is great, again a very good performance by Sacha Baron Cohen and most importantly: extremely heavy criticisms of the American lifestyle and the Trump administration, which is undoubtedly the point highest in the film.
Perhaps anyone who is not fully familiar with current US policy will not understand one or the other joke, but you can have fun just the same.
At certain moments in the film you will find yourself asking: What is this? How hasn't Sacha Baron Cohen been arrested yet ??
And this is just amazing.
But obviously not everything in the film is wonderful, it presents some problems of the first film, as things are resolved very easily and happen very fast, for me the first Borat (2007) is still better, but the second feature manages to honor the first well.
Borad (2020) is a great film, even though it is not perfect and a little inferior than the first, it is a great sequel and a very funny comedy film, with heavy criticisms and pertinent to the USA"

","Sacha Baron Cohen finds an actor with a comedic genius like his and the hysterical fun is now further through the roof!

Very current! Much better than the previous ones.
I could see a lot of growth and I think more of Sasha Baron Cohen, the man and artist, in this movie.
It dealt with so many different current issues and beliefs and was not really political because he poked fun at and exposed all sides.
Mostly he exposed the inappropriateness of us not getting along with one another in the USA.
I think I have described my take on the movie without giving away any specifics.

The faces we see and recognize in this wonderful concoction of modern fear are haunting. It's not just an innocent bystander. It's topical and it's brutally raw. Sadly it is a little one sided at points, which doesn't make for a thorough watch if you are looking to feel like everyone is getting it handed to them.

I will never forget the fertility dance, as long as I live. 🤣 There's also a bit of unexpected character depth and pathos which I didn't expect from this movie. This unlikely father-daughter story just works. 👏"

I am a big fan of first Borat but this one ruined my good memories from the first movie.
The main reason was that, the story of some one strange with American culture was already spoiled with first Borat, in fact Borat 2 was a fade version of the first one.
Also I believe the character of Borat's daughter wasn't a cool partner for Borat. In first Borat his colleague (Azamat) was an ideal character to complete Borat's character while the lack of this supporting character was obvious in the second.

I think the people involved weren't actors, but most of the scenes must have been scripted. I mean you could basically just see it by the bad acting! Except probably for the public scenes during the 'anti-covid' rally, the CPAC conference and the interview with Guiliani. But this just made the story a bit weaker in my opinion.

The only people I found authentic are the doctor at the pro life clinic, the Trump supporters at the rally and all of them who got their faces blurred at the concert. ***SPOILERS**** Besides that the only authentic reaction from a person that I believe is Rudy Giuliani where Borat's daughter took advantage of Giuliani's kindness (and naivety) by pretending to be a journalist and having an interview with him. After the interview has concluded you can see Borat's daughter setting up Giuliani by pretending to help him remove the wires from his clothes.

Infact I've gone from watching sequels to the original, and laughing less at the latter. Same goes for remakes, to an extent, and I'm not talking just comedies. This was funnier than I thought it'd be, but then again, I must realize who's responsible here, for this push the envelope comedy genius, and throwing all of the disastrous 2020 in with it .I was in no way disappointed at this sequel to one of the biggest iconic comedy characters, which Sasha Baron Cohen, a brilliant actor, expertly revives, in a superbly played role, not losing his form, one iota. Again with so much brazen gal, balseyness, it's just amazing how far he'll go, where no controversial figure as of recent, gets away unscathed, no more than our recent failing, brooding president. There is some immoral, if sometimes sick scenes, but we can only laugh. I will say there is some underlying adult themes, particularly a scene near the end, which paints a more serious shade of movie.I will say the spunky actress playing Borat's daughter really impressed me, and the storyline was fresh and original, with a classic story twist, that is in bad taste, and will catch you off guard. Cohen is very clever, in his style of comedy, and I know it's a style he'll never lose. That's guaranteed in laughs. An impressive mouth full of title too."

But still it was a 'Borat' movie. In this movie, the girl has been given too much time on screen and that saturated the regular Borat a bit. It's my opinion.

2) Doesn't take a single shot at the opposite side of the political spectrum. The current hyperprogressive hysteria has limitless potential for effective satire and would have actually been contrarian/edgy but Mr Cohen is actually more Bruno than Borat in real life.
3) The infamous Rudy Guiliani scene has some weird repetitive cuts from diffferent angles to make it seem like it's gone on for longer than it does. Whatever it is, it's certainly interesting and you've gotta give it to SBC for his rather unique brand of shock humor albeit point #2 sets this film back a few significant notches."

This film had arrived in such an aproppiate time that is unbelieveable, makes fun of Trump, Coronavirus and much more on a unique way that only our lord Sacha Baron Cohen could handle, and shows in this film his extraordinary talent not only because of his comic power (And method acting) but for being the kind of activist that we need right now, not the stupid type of activism who focus on victimism, but a comic and funny activism who searches for showing us the true colors of American Society without any political correction.
Also Maria did an amazing job portraying Borat´s daughter, she steals the scenes a lot of time and i hope for her to have a great future on acting

","Yet again Sacha Baron Cohen presents to us an outstanding work of filmmaking. It is difficult to imagine a better, more hilarious, and yet terrifying take at today's United States. Until you reach the end, you cannot take your eyes off the screen, and as it comes to an end, you are left with one question, ""What the hell was that!!!"" Well, that was racist, that was sexist, offensive, that was bad, but none of that matters, because that was Borat! If you want to watch this subsequent moviefilm, first throw all your expectations and all your understanding about filmmaking out of the window. Only then you can grasp how in all its vulgarity, in all its pointlessness it exposes the terrifying reality. And yes, it is a terrifying reality indeed. The sequel is way more scripted then the original movie, which was surprising, but perhaps necessary. As Borat himself puts, ""People make recognize my face"". That scene with Rudy Giuliani -- I would not spoil anything but would just say that the world needs more filmmakers like Cohen and fewer politicians like Giuliani. Mara Bakalova is another awesome gift of this movie, hope to see her appearing in more challenging roles in the future. In summary, Cohen, you have delivered a masterpiece that does not fall short of the original movie a bit, but rather stands as an excellent sequel, and also as an independent movie. Jagshemash!!!"

857,25-Oct-20,imdb-13900,10," Truly magnificent
","Just when you thought it was impossible to represent the US Republican ""alt-right"" community as any more absurd prejudiced and irrational than they choose to present themselves, in comes Sasha Baron Cohen in a series of exquisitely crafted ""set up"" mock interviews with ""real life"" participants.
By using the twinned barrelled foils of flattery, and apparent ignorance, he skilfully manages to expose the irrationality and inconsistencies of the current Trump administration and their supporters.
A great deal of effort has been made to sandwich carefully written ""backstories"" along with exquisite editing to create a strangely compelling narrative, worthy of the best ""screwball"" comedies, yet remaining overwhelmingly unsettling because it features ""real words, from real talking heads""
On many occasions the transition from ""made up"" to ""real life"" clips is entirely seamless - situations are clearly taken out of context, and doubtless we only get to see the ""best bits"" but nonetheless it's genuinely funny, and on occasions, excruciatingly uncomfortable.
Make no mistake, Cohen doesn't pull any punches, there is no attempt at ""balancing"" his argument, clearly there are scenes where they use actors who are ""in on the joke"" from the start and at others, it's only apparent in retrospect this must have been the case. Nevertheless, he makes a point, and makes a point well, that people should always challenge accepted norms, and the first thing you should ask is ""exactly what does this person stand for, and why does that benefit us"".
One of the great joys of this movie is that it's ""bang up to the minute"" - not only does it reflect the current US political agenda, it has in many ways contributed to that discourse.
It's rude, bawdy, and on occasions, deliberately revolting. I very nearly pressed the >> button a couple of times, but was immediately glad I didn't.

864,24-Oct-20,alexrambe-66864,9," No other film can give you THAT sensation
","Thank you Sacha you made me remember my good old days watching your show, I guess this is what nostalgia feels like. At first I was surprised that I was not liking the film at all, I asked myself, Have i changed? has he changed ? has the world changed? The ridiculous sex scenes, the obscene jokes, I began thinking that perhaps I just was not into it anymore,14 years had passed after all and in those days only my inner circle of friends managed to understand and love the film, it has always been a niche, the moment one character mentions the cellphones and how is everybody holding one was when it finally hit me how much time had really passed, 'oh yeah we really did use cellphones that much back then"" maybe I had grown old and grumpy and wouldn't like this movie at all. 30 minutes in and all my doubts had been removed.
THE CRINGE
That sensation that only this man knows how to produce in all its glory, luckily for me the online format allowed me to pause the film for moments to catch my breath, laugh a little and remember the good old days when this was fresh a new, many new things have appeared and therefore Borat needed adaptation, the interviews were out of the question for the simple fact that nobody would fall for that... so what can you do if you are Sacha Baron Cohen , when your main weapon is no longer usable? I give this rating based on the cleverness of the producers and writers to make this things work taking the circumstances into account, this film is better than the original, but it is not Fresh and fights with one hand tied to its back, in conclusion this film is not revolutionary like the first one, it is not timeless like the original, but it is true to its spirit and to the artist.
The moment to watch this movie is right now and it was made with that intention in mind. Today is a 9, 4 years from now...... probably not. But it is the best we can get."

When it comes to slapstick political satire comedy I'm pretty tolerant but this movie was mostly just annoying. I felt it was framed around two scenes with Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani and the rest was a weak plot to get there. Of course there were some funny ridiculous scenes but they didn't add up to an enjoyable, cohesive film.

And Maria baklova was an amazing edition here. Even though i wasn't sure anyone could match his spirit of character play which he takes it to extreme ways (which he did in this movie) she could do that too. In the recent interview sacha talked about choosing her from 500 candidates and she was given the script in UK and she has never been to US before yet did a mind-blowing job in the movie with her flawless acting and sacha was actually overshadowed by her performance which is crazy.

Felt way too forced and way too much political. I understand he wanted to do an anti-Trump movie, and release it before the elections, but this is Borat. This is not the Cohen TV show. Borat is a figure that we enjoyed world wide and was the sarcasm of the capitilistic West and the former Soviet, looking for a modern identity, wannabe capitalistic but still Soviet East. He could have made an anti-Trump TV movie instead, and promote it as such, and yes, then, it would be funny and great. But for a Borat movie, an international release, it's a NO."

For me, the three standout scenes that showcase this were; the abortion clinic, the final interview, and the ball. The daughters reaction to her father offering a large sum of money in exchange for Borat's daughter was priceless, and the fact it was so genuine made it 10x funnier.

From the top politician to the well-manered family to the everyday delivery man who does not seem to be bothered by the fact that a human person is trapped within a box.

","Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is easily the funniest movie of 2020 and perhaps one of the funniest of all time. A product of its' time, the film takes what are now familiar themes of Sasha Baron Cohen and incorporates them into Borat's familiar idiom. He takes you on long journey that ends in the present day with stops along the way to embarrass people left and right. He shows how strange our country has become and yet, it's a familiar kind of strange. The plot is very clever. How he pulled such an amazing series of events together is baffling. They must have had to constantly adapt to new circumstances until they got the results that made the most sense. Oh, and it's easily the funniest movie I've seen in many years.

","Borat (2020) is a movie we watched on Amazon Prime as soon as it was released. The storyline follows our good friend Borat when he returns to to the United States, this time with his daughter, to uncover critical details about the pandemic, election and disgrace that is the United States society. This movie is directed by Jason Woliner (The Last Man on Earth) and stars Sacha Baron Cohen (Bruno), Maria Bakalova (Fleabag) and Tom Hanks (Forest Gump). The comedic content in this was inconsistent but had some great display of the people who vote for Trump, their thought process and how rationale they come across with their thought processes, including members of his actual presidential regime. It was a very accurate representation on a large percentage of our society. The daughter to me wasn't as natural as Cohen in her role, she felt very awkward throughout the film; however, the scene with Giuliani was gold. Overall this isn't as good as the first film but was still fairly entertaining. I'd score this a 6.5/10."

","One thing I noticed about this film, was the heart. American's unwavering commitment to be polite, to mind their own, to show respect to foreigners who they have a business transaction with... We want them to say, ""how dare you?"" or ""you can't do that!"", but they are set up to believe that the people being filmed are important to some foreign country, and they want to be respectful on camera, and make their money to get by... Even at the Republican Women's meeting, though some women were fuming, they were respectful and championed the daughter to have a voice, which was admirable, even if I disagree with their fundamental world view. This is then juxtaposed with the hate and misogyny: how abortion is wrong no matter what the circumstances, how men and women would sell off a woman or take advantage of a woman at any point, the hate for other people, other countries... but, everyone has rights, which they are disappointed in but stick by.
So, if one was to walk away from this and go, it's just an attack on Republicans or Americans et al, I would say they have missed that it's actually against hate for others and against the misogynistic treatment of women at all levels in society, and not just in America, but it's mostly fighting against men who have done the wrong thing by women and their country."

","Sacha Baron Cohen dusts off his 14 year old Borat character and takes him back to the United States in order to ridicule himself and various moronic and/or ignorant groups and people. The intellectual variance is noteworthy - be prepared for everything from toilet humour to clever and disguised double entendres as Borat and his 15-year old daughter (played by Romanian actress Maria Bakalova) roam around the American backwoods looking for targets - some of which admittedly seem a little too easy and undeserving, whereas others more or less are asking for it. The film will probably come off as politically biased for viewers who are die hard fans of the Republican party and the ""McDonald Trump"" administration. And granted, if there's one problem with Borat Subsequent Movie, it's not that it lashes out at stupidity and prejudice, but that it doesn't lash out at stupidity and prejudice from a broad enough spectre. Still, you have to be pretty closed up to not appreciate what Cohen tries to do here - and the wildly amusing albeit painfully embarrassing way he does it."

And the cherry on all of this was Rudy Giuliani who didn't know about his involvement to the film until the very week it was released. Also he made himself look extremely creepier than usual. The female actress was a true rock star. Yes this was better than the first one. 10/10"

A lot of effort was put into this, it's clear, and the same disruptive pranks are followed throughout."
991,19-Jul-21,Abdulxoxo,6," Fairly amusing
","My feelings for this film are fairly similar to the last one. Some bits were funny, but much of it wasn't. The narrative structure of this film is there to begin with. It's ludicrous, but at least it's somewhat structured. It doesn't take too long however for the structure to begin to crack and the film to become mostly a collection of political and/or gross out skits. Obviously after the success of the first film Borat is a recognisable character. This is even brought up in the movie. For that reason Cohen has brought in Bakalova to play his daughter and sent her out to do most of the ballsy, cringe worthy stuff that he simply wouldn't be able to do anymore without people realising what was going on. I thought she stole this movie. She was involved in most of the funny scenes. One of the major issues I have when watching this, is what do they tell people about the cameras? There are some scenes where you can tell that we're watching real people reacting is real ways. There are some scenes that are obviously staged. There are also quite a few scenes though where we're meant to believe they are real, but I'm extremely sceptical. In those scenes I was slightly taken out of the movie as I was too busy trying to work out if the people were in on the joke, were they actors or were they just as stupid and gullible as they'd need to be to get genuinely pranked like this? When it comes to a film like this, it all comes down to taste. What somebody finds funny somebody else will find offensive. Sasha Baron Cohen, and Borat as a character, is all about pushing the boundaries. We all have a line. In the times where he stays on the right side for me there were a few laughs; but too often he goes over the line far enough for me to not find it funny. Overall, as expected this film did have some funny moments, but for the most part I didn't enjoy watching it."

There is a special chemistry between the two main characters and I really like how their daughter-father relationship evolves.

That being said, I just couldn't get the laughs from this film that I got from the original. I admit I found the actress playing the daughter super cute and both the main characters were talented, but the film relied so heavily on the same old jokes that I was barely able to muster a chuckle. For me, the primary laughs came from how ridiculous some of our political views sound when spoken out loud. I'd imagine too many people across the world they sound as ridiculous as they came across on screen.
Maybe I'm just older or too analytical not but I couldn't find the pranks as plausible as I did during the original.
With nothing else to do, it's a movie that passes the time but that's mostly all it is.
I'd imagine anyone who liked Borat is going to watch this and everyone else will pass, I can't imagine anyone being on the fence about this one..."

Very funny at times but very mild or bland or disgusting at others, story was coherent as very politically brown nose against the right, the movie is ultimately propaganda to vote. Sacha Baron Cohen was great, though lost a step from her previous version, Maria Bakalova was good acting but was no where near the level of sidekick as Azamt, Good but safe story, Very good but safe screenplay, Good direction (But misleading editing). Overall, This movie was a good look back into one of the greatest movies of all time but plays it safe and ultimately boils down into a movie urging the audience to vote out the right (making it a very topical movie at the present but something that will not make it a classic like its predecessor).

","Sacha Baron Cohen is arguably one of the hardest working actors out there, not in terms of the amount of work he churns out in a given year, but in his steadfast dedication to producing film that is as thought-provoking as it is cringe-inducing... Are you laughing with him, are you laughing at him, are you even laughing? I've been watching him since Ali-G first entered the house, and I've always felt uneasy whenever he is on-screen... You see, I'm not big on schadenfreude, I don't enjoy watching people being put on-the-spot, being made fun-of, squirming in their seats... In general it makes me feel sorry for them, and I feel a bit uneasy.
That being said, SBC takes the risks no one else seems to be willing to, and exposes the truths through satire that most people would prefer stayed hidden.
Is Borat 2, as I will call it for brevity's sake, better than Borat? In short no. It is a little less ""laugh-out-loud"" funny, it is also a little less vulgar (not saying that's a good thing), and a little less real feeling (probably a result of the first movie's success and SBC being way more recognized than before.)
However the addition of the lovely and talented Maria Bakalova (playing Borat's daughter, Tutar Sagdiyev), and the additional humanity, interactions, story-lines and character arcs that she brought with her performance helped to make up for all that.

Borat 1 was fully focused on humor with a mild attempt at building a story which was infinitely better than trying to build a family oriented story with a splash of political humor. Maybe Sacha fears how the leftist will eat him up if he continues mocking Kazakhstan. If this continues Borat movies will eventually loose its charm and will pretty much become a traditional Hollywood movie which takes a jibe at American politics which the rest of the world doesn't care about.

","Borat Subsequent Moviefilm or (Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan) is the follow up film to the classic 2006 comedy mockumentary Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Yeah, the titles are pretty humorous in themselves. The first Borat movie has to one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's hugely offensive yet rarely too in your face. It is also able to pack a subtle yet effective message about how America (and other countries to be fair) unfairly treat those who come from different cultures. However, Borat (2006) is first and for most a comedy film. The joke-per-minute ratio of that movie is insane and the fact that most of the jokes land make it that much better. When I heard that a sequel to this movie was coming out, I was both excited and skeptical. Since the character of Borat is so well known, it was going to be much harder to prank unsuspecting people. Add that to the fact that everyone is used to being recorded and are more cautious of what they say on camera than they were in 2006. However, I was still anticipating the release. Unfortunately, my doubts were somewhat proved right when I watched the film. It's not the worst thing in the world or anything, but it is far from even getting close to living up to the original.

There was to much time spent between Borat and his daughter which isn't what borat should be about it's about him being funny and making people uncomfortable. I get it people recognized him and that can be difficult and with saying that then I'm sorry don't make another movie then. This looked like a crash grab and or a political hit job to just say what everyone already hears in movies now which is trump sucks, vote Democrat. Okay we get it now can we get back to making movies funny and good again. I'm not political and sometimes I just don't want to hear it all the time when I just wanna sit back and watch a movie. I'm saying that there where some funny moments like when he's stuck inside with those two men other then that everything felt like the people where told there was a camera and didn't make it authentic. It was just weird to see a sequel of a movie that was such a cultural phenomenon and then completely make it about politics I mean everything was and then also making it very staged. So, in conclusion it was okay some funny parts but overall if I was to tell you that another borat movie came out you would not expect this kinda movie at all.

1102,26-Oct-20,vegard1989,2," Dishonest, mean and yet boring movie
","I think no one should stoop to such a low level of making a movie like this. It's a scripted and professionally filmed movie that supports a few scenes designed to shock you and 'uncover' something about others.
In reality, what happens is that Borat exploits other people's friendliness, openness and patience while insulting them with pubertal humor, having a camera crew in the bushes hoping for an improper reaction.
He does tricks from his older content, such as showing up and identifying with a group of people,appearing foreign and well-meaning, but then twisting the content more and more towards very inappropriate. It was funny back then, but this time around almost no one got fooled or reacted to any of his jokes, even though he tried harder and harder to shock. And when making something like a self proclaimed political commentary, with interviews of real people in a false context, I don't think this is an okay way of doing it. The 'shocking' scene at the end was a beautiful woman talking about how starstruck she was, flirting with that Rudy guy, then pulling him into a bedroom. Then Borat comes in yelling that she was 15, when in fact she was 24, playing a serious adult role of reporter, nothing like the more childish daughter role of earlier in the movie. Like some episode of how to catch a predator. There wasn't anything revealed there even. I don't know, I think it's tasteless and whatever story they are trying to serve it's viewers I think most would find it counter-productive to that."

","Comparing any sequel to an A+ original is going to be difficult. Having said that, I loved it. I thought he did a great job, especially with the fact that halfway through production, the virus hit and must have changed his original plan for the movie. When I think about it, the only thing I would have liked more is if there were less parts of him playing Borat being disguised as somebody else. Because, I get he's an international celebrity, though the first film was 15 years ago, I think he could have gotten away with being Borat in public more. But it was hilarious with many wild moments. And his daughter, Titar, was outstanding, I would love a spin-off show or film just with her character.

This kind of film is extremely difficult to make, it takes tremendous effort, bravery, and patience.. and they risk their lives to make this film (in the scene where Borat sings his new song, he had to wear body armor, and he was chased out by an angry mob which you can watch the behind the scenes video clip of this online). Both Sacha and Maria Bakalova only had one chance to film some of the scenes, and they never broke character.. so I give them tremendous props for their stellar performance. The storyline was a little generic and it wasn't that great, but the interactions with people was very good and funny.. you will see a variety of people in the movie, some are totally disgusting people, but some are very genuine..

","This is Borat 2. If you didn't get the humor of the first Borat movie you won't get it here either so don't bother watching or reviewing this. Like the first one, this movie had me laughing at the over-the-top portrayal of a backwards man from a backwards country with a lot of stupid sex jokes and shock-material. I also laughed at the all-to-real backwards Americans with the understanding that a lot of what we are seeing is very cleverly edited to make the dupes seem even more ridiculous. If you read interviews of the dupes from the first movie you realize that all is not as it seems. Hours worth of footage is presented as minute-long encounters in which people say really stupid things or appear to agree with Borat on some very risque subjects. So, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT! I'm sure that we'll hear more stories of how Sasha Baron Cohen and his crew deceived or otherwise bamboozled the people in the movie to act as they did, but we will most likely also conclude that fancy editing aside, some of those people really did say some pretty offensive things. For example, it really doesn't matter how silly a song Borat was singing to the crowd of Texans to make them all look like imbecilic conspiracy theorists, the guy who throws a Nazi salute up is an over-the-top moron.
Like the first movie, this one had too many scenes that seem too contrived and a stretch of the imagination in order to shock or get laughs. Some of it just wasn't all that funny to me, but it had plenty of laughs otherwise. All-in-all, it was entertaining and I watched it for free thanks to Amazon Prime.
But wait -- there's more! I have to take issue with the way that the media, Cohen and the production company have portrayed Rudy Giuliani here. I admit that I was a Rudy fan when I lived in New York and was very impressed with the way he conducted himself on 9/11, but I think he's lost his mind with age and has become nothing short of a hand-puppet for the most (the hugist) imbecilic conspiracy theorist, McDonald Trump. That said, I felt manipulated by the footage of Rudy and had to rewind it several times to try to align what I saw with what I read in the press. CNN and the New York Times would have us believe that he was caught making sexy time (or trying to) with Borat's daughter. What I saw was him stupidly agreeing to finish the interview in the bedroom with an attractive, much younger woman and being a bit touchy-feely (patting her on her hip). What I also saw was a quick shot of him trying to get her hair or microphone or something out of a button or zipper on the top of her dress. It appears that we are missing the lead-up to this, like, perhaps, her asking for him to help her get unstuck) making it even more likely that it was edited to make it look like he was unbuttoning her to get her undressed. The press made a very big deal about him laying on the bed putting his hands down his pants ostensibly to touch his penis. What I saw was her taking his microphone unit from the waist of his pants (you can see it in her hand as she lifts her hands from his pants) and then he lays back to tuck his shirt back in; anyone else who is a bit overweight with a larger belly knows that this is an efficient way to get tucked back in. I understand that the Trump administration is a bunch of ass-clowns just asking to be made fun of, but let's at least show the real stupidity of these people without resorting to the very type of fakery that the conspiracy theorists point to as proof that the holocaust never occurred. And stop feeding the extreme left-wing nut-jobs at CNN and the New York Times."

Now of course with this year in America being as insane as it is there's a lot of material to work with, and I like that Sacha Baron Cohen returned to this character after all this time with a clear purpose behind the offensiveness and shocking shenanigans. However, what was so great about the original was that the comedy and reactions were at the forefront, with the satire and hidden message behind the encounters much more subtle and cleverly hidden. This did result in a lot of claims of anti-semitism, racism and the like (it's easier to be offended than to think about jokes) but I liked how the film functioned in two different ways for everyone to enjoy - a hilarious Jackass-esque prank movie and a clever satire on the hidden prejudices and social problems of America."

","Like Brüno and the original Borat, this movie uses an exaggerated character to expose the latent prejudices ingrained in American culture - xenophobia, misogyny, racism - fact and fiction become muddled as everyday Americans prove themselves to be more farcical than this made-up character. This was a lot more scripted than the other films, making it ultimately less memorable and impactful, but the line being blurred between fact and fiction - the notion that the world is truly stranger than fiction - is pretty effective. There were a lot of shoehorned callbacks to the first film that really didn't work for me, and the commentary is much less subtle, but overall, I enjoyed it. If this interests you, I suggest you watch it as soon as possible - I don't know how well this film is going to hold up in fourteen years. The original Borat is still so relevant, but this film is so specific to the current political climate in its satire that I can't see it holding THAT much weight in a decade's time."

1220,25-Oct-20,jonathanakcay,9," GREAT SUCCESS
","Let's be honest, when the movie was first announced it was exciting to hear that Borat was returning on the big screen. The first movie was a near-perfect comedy that, to this day, has you laughing from beginning to end. How could a sequel even come close to that standard when damn near everyone knows who Borat the character is? After laughing my ass off for an hour and a half it's safe to say that Borat is back and better than ever. Cohen's ability as both an actor and a comedian shine brightest when he's exposing political and social climates. His ability to stay in character and push people's buttons to the max is remarkable, let alone the comedic elements of making fun of various groups. Look, I don't think anyone was expecting this movie to be nearly as funny as the first, that's why I have to give this movie a 9 if the original Borat is a 10 (in terms of sheer comedy)."
1221,25-Oct-20,justino1996,5," Wonderful setups, disappointing execution
","The original Borat struck the world at the PERFECT time. A time when certain topics deserved to be questioned and satirized when they commonly weren't. Borat was a breath of fresh-woke-air. Sadly, 16 years later, Borat Subsequent Movie Film marginally fails to match the payoff of its culturally classic original. Every joke is based upon political/social satire, just like the original, but never once goes over the realm of being anything funnier than something you saw on College Humor or SNL four years ago. Every joke is there waiting to be told, but never attempts to be anything more than a ""that's funny"" comment. The film feels incredibly safe when it should have let itself let loose and stir the pot like it did almost two decades ago. A lot of this can be related to the lives we live now where politics have become hyper saturated and aggressive to the point where nothing makes us ""surprised"" anymore. I can't let that excuse the new Borat, but I think it may have been a roadblock that is impossible to to hurtle in this political climate. To more technical faults, the director clearly did not have a sense of classical comedic pacing; every joke is a mile a minute, not unlike a new episode of family guy. We never get the chance to examine Borat's reactions to the cultural divide that made his first outing so charming but realizing. This is a film that would have greatly, and I mean greatly, come to excellent realization as a multi-part series not unlike modern streaming-only documentaries. I feel this would have been the true home of the beloved Borat Sagdiyev. To conclude, there's visual enjoyment to be had, however, there's nothing here you can't get from watching YouTube for the 97 minute running of Borat Subsequent Movie Film."

1226,25-Oct-20,datrax,6," Not as funny as Borat, but worth a watch
","Unfortunately nothing like the first film, aside from the central hi-jinks surrounding the Borat character, which is the main strong point that delivers the most laughs. Whereas the first centered around making the unwilling subjects react in stranger than fiction ways, here much of the ""docu-comedy"" action is or appears to be scripted, and there's a rather drawn out boring middle section weighed down by this, where you only really keep watching for the central ""plot"" and comedy of Borat's ""mission"". It's unavoidable that the character is now too well-known to get away with the stunts of the original Borat, but it nonetheless weighs the comedy down a fair bit and feels rather hollow at times. As does the ham-fisted hit-and-miss propaganda-comedy moments of.. dressing up in a ""Trumpsuit"" to crash a GOP Pence talk that falls rather flat, and a curious bit with Guiliani that is nothing like the headlines it garnered and seems designed more to sway votes than deliver comedy; without spoiling too much, as there's little to nothing to spoil; one of the characters pretends to be a reporter who tries to seduce Giuliani and appears to succeed, proving what would come as little shock to most, that most powerful people won't say no to sleeping with an attractive journalist if given the chance, but the whole entrapment joke is rather ruined when Borat burst in at the moment suprème to try and get some clickbait headlines out of the whole ordeal, ruining whatever slight comedic value it presented. And given Guiliani was actually re-iterating stuff in the interview I rather agree with without being a Republican, it all felt like a rather stunted political prank that was neither daring nor really that interesting, and rather begs the question if the whole film weren't commissioned by the Biden camp in some form. Which, aside from dialing down the comedic value yet some more, just doesn't deliver much in the way of Borat-style comedy we've seen so far. Nonetheless it's worth a watch, and the first 15 minutes are immediately very funny, I recommend to watch it for the SBC character comedy alone and not expect too much in the way of classic Borat semi-improvisational comedy, because I'm hard-pressed to remember any segment that either wasn't or didn't feel like it was entirely scripted with actors pretending to be clerks or barbershop customers or a plastic surgery clinic. Luckily it's somewhat made up for by the character comedy, but it only manages to reach the heights of the original, or The Dictator, on a few occasions. Still worth watching. 6/10"
