## ABOUT ME 

HI There ! 

I am Assel, a "QAZAQ" women with 8+ years in Marriott Hotels (3 properties).Managing a luxury hotel department has shaped my leadership skills and taught me excellence.  Grateful for exceptional mentors during my Marriott journey, I broke barriers as the only female manager in my department in a Middle Eastern country, skillfully leading a diverse team of 20 from 8 countries. 

Feeling intellectually hungry, I've unleashed my passion for data with a masters degree in the data world.

Curiosity drives me - I ask questions and hunt for answers! 

P.S QAZAQ means free and it happend to be my nationality ^-^.

## WHAT I CAN DO 

In this repository, you will find three projects I previously built:

- Personal Loan Prediction Model (R)
- Stroke Prediction Model (Jupyter Notebook)
- Sentiment Analysis of Elon Musk Tweets (Python)

Additionally, I have included some Tableau dashboards that I created for practice, as well as MySQL simple queries to demonstrate my skills.
